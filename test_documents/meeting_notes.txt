DISCUSSION SUMMARY:

1. PROJECT STATUS UPDATE

Sarah Johnson presented the current project status:
- Web application: 85% complete, on track for May 30 delivery
- Mobile apps: iOS 70% complete, Android 65% complete
- API integration: 90% complete
- Database migration: Completed ahead of schedule

Concerns raised:
- Recent downtime incident on April 10 (lasted 3 hours)
- Two critical bugs discovered in payment processing module
- Mobile app testing delayed due to resource constraints

2. PERFORMANCE ISSUES

Mary Williams expressed concerns about the April 10 downtime incident:
- System was unavailable from 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM EST
- Affected approximately 1,500 users
- Root cause: Database connection pool exhaustion
- Financial impact: Estimated $25,000 in lost revenue

Michael Chen explained the technical details:
- Issue was caused by a memory leak in the connection pooling code
- Fix has been implemented and deployed
- Additional monitoring has been added to prevent recurrence
- Post-mortem report to be delivered by April 20

Action Items:
- TechServices to provide detailed incident report (Due: April 20)
- Implement additional load testing (Due: April 25)
- Review and update disaster recovery procedures (Due: May 1)

3. BUDGET REVIEW

Current spend: $455,000 of $780,000 annual budget (58%)
Projected overrun: $45,000 due to:
- Additional security audit requirements: $15,000
- Extended testing phase: $20,000
- Infrastructure upgrades: $10,000

John Smith approved the budget increase with the following conditions:
- Detailed breakdown of additional costs required
- No further overruns without prior written approval
- Monthly budget reviews going forward

4. TIMELINE ADJUSTMENTS

Original timeline vs. Revised timeline:
- Web app launch: May 30 → June 15 (2-week delay)
- iOS app: June 15 → June 30 (2-week delay)
- Android app: June 30 → July 15 (2-week delay)

Reasons for delays:
- Additional security requirements from legal team
- Extended user acceptance testing period
- Integration issues with third-party payment gateway

Sarah Johnson committed to:
- Adding two additional developers to mobile team
- Weekend work to minimize delays where possible
- Daily status updates during critical phases

5. CONTRACTUAL MATTERS

Mary Williams raised concerns about SLA compliance:
- March uptime: 99.7% (below 99.9% target)
- April uptime: 98.8% (significantly below target)
- Average response time to critical issues: 3.2 hours (above 2-hour target)

Discussion of potential remedies:
- Service credits for missed SLAs
- Additional resources to improve response times
- Review of escalation procedures

John Smith indicated that ACME may invoke the termination clause if performance 
does not improve by end of Q2 (June 30, 2024).

Sarah Johnson acknowledged the concerns and proposed:
- Immediate assignment of dedicated on-call engineer
- Implementation of automated monitoring and alerting
- Weekly performance review meetings
- Service credits totaling $15,000 for March and April SLA misses

DECISIONS MADE:

1. Approved budget increase of $45,000
2. Accepted revised timeline with June 15 web app launch
3. Agreed to service credits of $15,000 for SLA misses
4. Scheduled weekly performance review meetings every Monday at 10 AM EST
5. TechServices to add dedicated on-call engineer starting April 20

NEXT STEPS:

1. TechServices to provide incident report (Sarah - April 20)
2. Legal teams to review service credit terms (Both parties - April 22)
3. Implement enhanced monitoring (Michael - April 25)
4. Budget breakdown document (Lisa - April 18)
5. Next project review meeting: May 6, 2024 at 2:00 PM EST

RISKS AND CONCERNS:

- Potential for contract termination if Q2 performance targets not met
- Budget constraints may limit ability to add resources
- Third-party payment gateway integration proving more complex than anticipated
- Mobile app store approval process may add additional delays

NOTES:

John Smith emphasized the importance of this project to ACME's digital transformation 
strategy and expressed disappointment with recent performance issues. However, he 
acknowledged TechServices' transparency and willingness to address concerns.

Sarah Johnson committed to making this the top priority for TechServices and assured 
the team that all necessary resources would be allocated to ensure success.

Meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM EST.
