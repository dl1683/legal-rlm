Your task is to create a strategic research plan. Think like an experienced litigator or investigator.

Consider:
1. What are the CORE legal issues that need to be established?
2. Which document types are MOST LIKELY to contain direct evidence? (e.g., contracts for terms, emails for intent, financials for damages)
3. What SPECIFIC search terms will find relevant passages? Include legal terms, party names, key dates, and transaction-specific language.
4. What is your preliminary hypothesis based on the query structure?

PRIORITIZE:
- Primary source documents (contracts, pleadings) over secondary (correspondence)
- Documents with dates matching key events
- Files mentioning specific parties or amounts
