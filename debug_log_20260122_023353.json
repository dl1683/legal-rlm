    "For the 144-month inspection in 2020 at Gulfstream's Savannah facility, the initial cost estimate (quote) was approximately $350,000. The actual cost for this inspection ultimately reached approximately $1 million, which was more than three times the initial quote.",
    "For the 192-month inspection (inputted January 2024), Gulfstream US (St. Louis facility) provided a proposal with estimated costs of $835,931. This estimate included options for a new insulation package ($268,207) and an upgrade to MCDUs ($201,764).",
    "The owner understood the 192-month inspection proposal's estimates and quotes to cover all required work for the entire maintenance event, including likely findings, with an expected variance of around 20% for unexpected issues.",
    "For the 192-month inspection, there have already been 'massive cost and manhour overruns,' with actual manhours already exceeding 14,000 hours versus the quoted 2,800 hours. A specific total actual monetary cost for the 192-month inspection is not yet stated in these snippets.",
    "The owner believes Gulfstream, as the OEM, should have anticipated potential corrosion and provided a more realistic estimate for the 192-month inspection from the outset, especially considering its access to historical data, the aircraft's specific maintenance history (including the 144-month inspection), and the introduction of a new data analytics tool in July 2023 that was not used for their proposal.",
    "Gulfstream submitted a customer support proposal dated 02 June 2023 for the Aircraft\u2019s 192-month inspection (the \u201cProposal\u201d).",
    "The Proposal quoted an initial workscope cost of $835,931.",
    "Gulfstream originally estimated 2,800 manhours were required to perform the 192-month inspection and services.",
    "The initial downtime estimated by Gulfstream was 35-45 business days.",
    "Provided the Aircraft was input on January 29, 2024, Gulfstream's initial estimated return to service date was April 1, 2024.",
    "Despite having new data collection and analytical capabilities since July 2023, Gulfstream did not revise or update its Proposal, nor the estimated manhours, downtime or costs before CITIOM input the Aircraft.",
    "Soon after the Aircraft was input, Gulfstream claimed that additional work, and attendant costs and manhours, were necessary.",
    "In April 2024, Gulfstream estimated an additional 5,730 hours of scope growth since March 6, 2024.",
    "As of the beginning of May 2024, the project was 14,000 hours over the quoted 2,800 manhours.",
    "On May 24, 2024, Gulfstream advised of an additional 1,200 hours required for work.",
    "Gulfstream was unable to meet the Aircraft\u2019s original estimated return to service date of April 1, 2024.",
    "In April 2024, Gulfstream advised the estimated completion date would be June 21, 2024.",

    "In July 2024, Gulfstream advised that the return to service forecast was further extended to December 16, 2024.",
    "On August 19, 2024, Gulfstream advised that the estimated completion date will \u201clikely be in mid-November 2024,\u201d more than seven months after the initial estimated return to service date.",
    "CITIOM claims Gulfstream has charged CITIOM for many repairs which should be covered by Gulfstream warranties.",
    "CITIOM has suffered economic injuries in the amount of at least $4,800,000, and growing, as a result of Gulfstream\u2019s misrepresentations and delays.",

    "The plaintiff alleges that 'out-of-pocket costs' were entirely predictable because Gulfstream refused to update the initial quote.",

    "Gulfstream had internal data showing G550 inspections at St. Louis routinely exceeded 100\u2013300 days.",
    "The supporting evidence for 'Lost Charter Profit' includes 'Gulfstream quote vs. actual'.",
    "Gulfstream submitted a proposal for the 192-month inspection beginning in January 2024, quoting their work scope cost at approximately $836,000, in addition to certain other items that Gulfstream indicated would be assessed during the input of the Aircraft.",

    "Gulfstream was unable to meet the original April 1, 2024, RTS date.",
    "By April 2024, Gulfstream estimated 'an additional 5,730 hours of scope growth,' bringing the total estimated manhours to approximately 8,530, and revised the estimated completion date to June 21, 2024.",
    "The RTS date was further extended to December 16, 2024, and then later revised to 'mid-November' 2024.",
    "Internal documents suggest that actual manhours 'tripled, then quadrupled' compared to the initial estimate, and Gulfstream made 'misrepresentations and provided unrealistic estimates' regarding manhours, timeline, and costs.",
    "The document does not provide a specific dollar amount for Gulfstream's initial cost estimate for the 192-month inspection of the G550 S/N 5174 aircraft.",
    "The document states that Gulfstream's proposals for major structural inspections, such as the 192-month inspection, quote only 'the work to perform the inspection itself,' which includes 'the costs associated with accessing the areas that need to be inspected and performing the inspection itself.'",
    "Gulfstream's proposals 'expressly exclud[e] from the quote the work associated with repairing any discrepancies that are discovered during the inspection.'",
    "The document explains that MROs like Gulfstream do not estimate the downtime required to correct discrepancies because the downtime depends on the nature and scope of the discrepancies discovered during the inspection, which cannot be predicted until the inspection is performed.",
    "Regarding estimated costs of repairing discrepancies, the document states there is 'no industry standard'; some repair stations, like Gulfstream, 'do not include estimates for costs of repairing discrepancies,' while others, like Bombardier, 'do provide a range of estimates for cost of repairing discrepancies.'",
    "The document provides an example of a Bombardier proposal from 2021 for an earlier inspection that offered an 'Average discrepancies Guideline' of $12,200 to $36,600.",
    "The document does not provide any specific dollar amounts for the actual costs incurred for the 192-month inspection of the G550 S/N 5174 aircraft.",
    "Because specific initial cost estimates (in dollar amounts) and actual costs for the 192-month inspection of G550 S/N 5174 are not present in this document, a direct comparison of numerical values cannot be made from the provided content.",

    "Gulfstream prepared and presented the Customer Support Proposal dated 02 June 2023 (the \"Proposal\", CIT00001 \u2013 CIT00028) for the 192-month inspection of the Aircraft.",
    "Gulfstream's initial cost estimate in the Proposal was $835,932 plus certain items to be evaluated at input (ASOC \u00b6 10, Ex. 1; Proposal p. 12 of the brief referring to the Proposal document).",
