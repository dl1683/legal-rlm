    "For the 144-month inspection of the Gulfstream G550 Aircraft (MSN 5174), Gulfstream's Savannah facility initially quoted approximately $350,000 for the work.",
    "The actual cost for the 144-month inspection ultimately reached approximately $1 million, which was more than nearly three times the initial quote.",
    "For the 192-month inspection of the Aircraft, Gulfstream US (St. Louis facility) provided an estimated cost of $835,931. This estimate included options for a new insulation package ($268,207) and MCDU upgrades ($201,764).",
    "The estimated downtime for the 192-month inspection was 35-45 working days, with an implied quoted manhours of approximately 2,800 (derived from later comparison).",
    "During the 192-month inspection, there were 'massive cost and manhour overruns,' with manhours already exceeding 14,000 hours compared to the quoted 2,800, but a final actual monetary cost for the 192-month inspection is not provided in these excerpts.",
    "The owner understood the proposals to cover the entire maintenance event, including likely findings, with a reasonable variance of around 20%, not just inspection tasks.",
    "Gulfstream did not use its new data analytics capabilities (introduced July 2023) to update the 192-month inspection proposal before it was signed in September 2023 or before the Aircraft's input in January 2024, despite the tool being designed for more accurate cost and downtime information.",
    "Gulfstream submitted a customer support proposal dated 02 June 2023 for the Aircraft\u2019s 192-month inspection.",
    "The Proposal quoted an initial workscope cost of $835,931.",
    "Gulfstream originally estimated 2,800 manhours were required to perform the 192-month inspection and services.",
    "The initial estimated downtime was 35-45 business days.",
    "If the Aircraft was input on January 29, 2024, Gulfstream's original estimated return to service date was April 1, 2024.",
    "Despite having new data collection and analytical capabilities since July 2023, Gulfstream did not revise or update its Proposal, estimated manhours, downtime, or costs before CITIOM input the Aircraft.",
    "Soon after the Aircraft was input, Gulfstream claimed additional work, costs, and manhours were necessary.",
    "In April 2024, Gulfstream was unable to meet the Aircraft\u2019s original estimated return to service of April 2024.",
    "In April 2024 (specifically an email dated April 5, 2024), Gulfstream estimated an additional 5,730 hours of scope growth since March 6, 2024, projecting a total of 8,530 manhours (2,800 initial + 5,730 additional).",
    "In April 2024, Gulfstream advised the estimated completion date would be June 21, 2024.",
    "On May 17, 2024, Gulfstream advised a further extended return to service date of August 1, 2024.",
    "As of the beginning of May 2024, the project was 14,000 hours over the quoted 2,800 hours, meaning a total of 16,800 manhours (2,800 quoted + 14,000 over-quoted).",
    "On May 24, 2024, Gulfstream advised a further extended return to service date of August 15, 2024, with an additional 1,200 hours required for work, bringing the total estimated manhours to 18,000 (16,800 as of May + 1,200 additional).",
    "The return to service date was subsequently extended to August 20, 2024, then August 27, 2024, then September 19, 2024.",
    "In July 2024, Gulfstream advised that the return to service forecast was further extended to December 16, 2024.",

    "CITIOM believes that under-estimating repair time and cost is a common practice of Gulfstream, and has affected numerous other customers (Paragraph 85).",
    "Gulfstream's initial proposal for the 192-Month Inspection estimated a cost of $800,000 and 35-45 days downtime.",
    "Gulfstream's initial estimates were considered unrealistic, misleading, and lower than typically experienced, as they failed to include potential additional costs, particularly those arising from discrepancies discovered during the inspection.",
    "The proposal's deficiency in addressing potential discrepancy costs and escalation resulted in unrealistic cost expectations and contributed to additional costs and cost overruns due to delays and mismanagement.",
    "Industry standard practice for such proposals includes estimated costs for discrepancies (e.g., $250-400K USD, or an estimated over-and-above amount of $234,000 for a $1,100,000 project), which Gulfstream's initial proposal omitted.",
    "Gulfstream prepared and presented the Customer Support Proposal dated 02 June 2023 (the \"Proposal\", CIT00001 \u2013 CIT00028) for the 192-month inspection of the Aircraft.",
    "Gulfstream's initial cost estimate in the Proposal, as summarized in Part IV, Executive Summary and Proposal Acceptance, totaled $835,932 plus certain items to be evaluated at input (ASOC \u00b6 10, Ex. 1; Proposal p. 12).",
    "The Proposal critically omits potential downtime and costs arising from discrepancies discovered during a major inspection (Farnham p. 5).",
    "Internal correspondence confirms that \"SN 5174 was quoted in June 2023, so the downtime was included using the previous downtime methodology,\" and that while Gulfstream had comparative invoice-based work scope data available at the time, \"we currently do not have plans to publish such data in our proposals.\" (GAC0037301; GAC0039509).",
    "The actual costs for the 192-month inspection were $3,879,972.80 (GAC0052474).",
    "Gulfstream's initial cost estimates (proposals/quotes) for major structural inspections, such as the 144-month or 192-month inspection, cover only the work required to perform the inspection itself.",
    "This inspection work includes costs associated with the removal of the interior furnishings, providing access to structural elements, and performing the inspection tasks.",
    "Gulfstream's proposals expressly exclude from the quote the work and associated costs for repairing any discrepancies that are discovered during the inspection.",
    "Gulfstream, like some other repair stations, does not include estimates for costs of repairing discrepancies in its maintenance proposals.",
    "There is no uniform or industry standard regarding whether MRO facilities include estimated repair costs for discrepancies in their proposals; some provide a range, others do not.",
    "Gulfstream has been following this same process for quoting major structural inspections for an extended, unstated period (referred to as 'as long as I can remember').",
    "Gulfstream provides standard downtime quotes for particular inspection tasks across the board for all aircraft of a particular model; it does not provide custom estimates for individual aircraft based on their records, operating environment, utilization, or usage profile.",
    "The document states that the Farnham report claims it is industry standard for aircraft maintenance proposals to include estimated downtime and estimated costs associated with correcting discrepancies discovered during major structural inspections, but the expert (Leonard A. Beauchemin) disagrees with this assertion.",
    "For MROs that do include cost estimates for correcting discrepancies, they typically provide a range rather than a specific estimate (e.g., a Bombardier proposal from 2021 offered an 'Average discrepancies Guideline' of $12,200 to $36,600 for a much earlier and less onerous inspection).",
    "The document does not provide the specific numerical value of Gulfstream's initial cost estimate for the 192-month inspection of the G550 S/N 5174 aircraft.",
    "The document does not provide the actual costs incurred for the 192-month inspection or subsequent repairs for the G550 S/N 5174 aircraft.",
    "In connection with the Aircraft's 192-month inspection, Gulfstream submitted a proposal for certain work to be performed beginning in January 2024.",
    "Gulfstream's Proposal quoted their work scope cost at approximately $836,000.",
    "The Proposal indicated certain other items would be assessed during the input of the Aircraft.",
    "The Aircraft was estimated to be out of service with an initial downtime of 35-45 business days.",
    "The Aircraft was estimated to have a return to service date of April 1, 2024.",
    "CITIOM alleges that this initial quote of expected repair costs and timeline were among the material misrepresentations of Gulfstream.",
    "During the Aircraft\u2019s input process, Gulfstream communicated that its original estimate of 2,800 labor hours was not adequate.",
    "Gulfstream communicated that the Aircraft would not be available on April 1, 2024.",
    "Sometime in April 2024, Gulfstream conceded that it would be unable to meet the April 2024 return date.",
    "Gulfstream instead provided a completion date of June 21, 2024.",
    "In April 2024, Gulfstream estimated an additional 5,730 hours of work.",
    "On May 17, 2024, Gulfstream extended the return to service date until August 1, 2024.",
