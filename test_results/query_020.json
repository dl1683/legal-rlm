  "hypothesis": "The date for the *Amended* Statement of Claim has been identified as September 9, 2024, and its existence is further corroborated by references in the Claimant's Pre-Hearing Brief. The date for the *original* Statement of Claim or initial Demand for Arbitration (which Gulfstream responded to on August 7, 2024) remains to be determined, but is expected in primary arbitration filings related to the commencement of CPR arbitration Case No. G-24-115-AA between Channel IT Isle of Man Ltd. and Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation.",
  "final_output": "**MEMORANDUM**\n\n**TO:** Senior Partner\n**FROM:** [Your Name/Department]\n**DATE:** [Current Date]\n**RE:** Filing Date of Statement of Claim in *Channel IT Isle of Man Ltd. v. Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation*, CPR Case No. G-24-115-AA\n\n---\n\n### **Executive Summary**\nCITIOM filed its Amended Statement of Claim on September 9, 2024. The arbitration was formally initiated several months prior, when CITIOM commenced the proceeding by serving a Notice of Arbitration dated May 31, 2024. These dates are consistently referenced across multiple case documents, though the primary filings themselves remain unverified.\n\n### **Factual Background**\nThe dispute concerns alleged breaches by Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (\"Gulfstream\") related to the 192-Month Inspection of a Gulfstream G550 Aircraft owned by Channel IT Isle of Man Ltd. (\"CITIOM\"). The aircraft was input with Gulfstream for inspection on January 29, 2024. Subsequently, a dispute arose over delays and performance failures.\n\nThe key procedural events are as follows:\n*   **May 31, 2024:** CITIOM commenced arbitration against Gulfstream pursuant to a Notice of Arbitration of this date [Claimant CITIOM Pre-Hearing Brief - Apr 14 2025 (1).pdf, p. 2] [UNVERIFIED]; [Evidence Gathered].\n*   **August 7, 2024:** Gulfstream filed its Notice of Defense and Counterclaim in response to CITIOM's initial claim [Claimant CITIOM Pre-Hearing Brief - Apr 14 2025 (1).pdf, p. 2] [UNVERIFIED].\n*   **September 9, 2024:** CITIOM filed an Amended Statement of Claim (\"ASOC\") [Claimant CITIOM Pre-Hearing Brief - Apr 14 2025 (1).pdf, p. 2] [UNVERIFIED]; [CITIOM First Req for Production on Gulfstream - Oct 18 2024.pdf, p. 2] [UNVERIFIED].\n\n### **Analysis**\n\n#### **Key Findings**\n1.  **The operative pleading, CITIOM's Amended Statement of Claim, was filed on September 9, 2024.** This date is referenced in CITIOM’s subsequent discovery requests and its Pre-Hearing Brief [CITIOM First Req for Production on Gulfstream - Oct 18 2024.pdf, p. 2] [UNVERIFIED]; [Claimant CITIOM Pre-Hearing Brief - Apr 14 2025 (1).pdf, p. 2] [UNVERIFIED]. A verified copy of the document titled `CITIOM Amended Statement of Claim.pdf` exists in the case file, corroborating its existence [6].\n\n2.  **The arbitration was formally commenced on May 31, 2024.** Evidence indicates that CITIOM initiated the proceedings via a Notice of Arbitration dated May 31, 2024 [Claimant CITIOM Pre-Hearing Brief - Apr 14 2025 (1).pdf, p. 2] [UNVERIFIED]. In arbitration under CPR Rules, the Notice of Arbitration serves as the initial claim document that formally commences the case.\n\n#### **Supporting Evidence**\nThe conclusion regarding the two key dates is supported by consistent, though unverified, documentary evidence:\n*   A direct reference in CITIOM’s Pre-Hearing Brief states: \"On September 9, 2024, Claimant filed the ASOC\" [73] [UNVERIFIED].\n*   A separate discovery document, CITIOM’s First Request for Production, also refers to \"CITIOM’s Statement of Claim dated September 9, 2024\" [26] [UNVERIFIED].\n*   The same Pre-Hearing Brief establishes the initial commencement date: \"CITIOM commenced this Arbitration on May 31, 2024\" [72] [UNVERIFIED].\n*   Gulfstream’s response timeline further corroborates the commencement date. Gulfstream filed its Notice of Defense and Counterclaim on August 7, 2024, which necessarily post-dates the initial claim filing of May 31, 2024 [74] [UNVERIFIED].\n\n#### **Contradictions or Concerns**\nThere is no contradictory evidence regarding the filing dates. The primary concern is that the documents explicitly stating these dates (`Claimant CITIOM Pre-Hearing Brief` and `CITIOM First Req for Production on Gulfstream`) have not been verified. While multiple documents corroborate these dates, the conclusion relies on secondary references rather than the primary filings themselves.\n\n#### **Evidence Strength Assessment**\n**Moderate.** The evidence is not rated as \"Strong\" because the most direct citations are unverified. However, the consistency of these dates across multiple independent documents (a pre-hearing brief and a discovery request), combined with the verified existence of a document titled `CITIOM Amended Statement of Claim.pdf`, provides a reliable basis for our findings. The chronological consistency with Gulfstream's response date further strengthens the conclusion.\n\n### **Entities & Relationships**\n*   **Claimant:** Channel IT Isle of Man Ltd. (\"CITIOM\")\n*   **Respondent:** Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (\"Gulfstream\")\n*   **Claimant's Counsel:** Watson Farley & Williams LLP [Evidence Gathered]\n*   **Claimant's Damages Expert:** FAZ Forensics [Evidence Gathered]\n\n### **Gaps & Limitations**\n*   **Evidence NOT Found:** The source documents for the most crucial citations, specifically the `Claimant CITIOM Pre-Hearing Brief` and `CITIOM First Req for Production on Gulfstream`, were not located for verification. Furthermore, a copy of the initial Notice of Arbitration dated May 31, 2024, is not present in the analyzed materials.\n*   **Areas for Further Investigation:** The investigation should prioritize locating and verifying the primary source documents mentioned above to confirm the dates definitively.\n*   **Limitations:** The conclusions herein are contingent on the accuracy of the unverified secondary references.\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1.  **Immediate Actions:** Update all internal case management systems and chronologies to reflect that the arbitration was commenced on **May 31, 2024**, and the Amended Statement of Claim was filed on **September 9, 2024**. Clearly mark that the sources for these dates are currently unverified.\n2.  **Additional Investigation:** Direct the case team to prioritize obtaining and verifying copies of the Claimant's Pre-Hearing Brief and the initial Notice of Arbitration to secure primary evidence of the key filing dates.\n3.  **Risk Mitigation:** Until the primary documents are verified, all strategic decisions based on these filing dates should be made with the awareness that they are based on strong but unconfirmed secondary evidence.",

    "The Gulfstream Work Authorization Terms and Conditions ('T&C') contain an exclusion of damages clause (Section 8) stating Gulfstream Parties shall not be liable for punitive, special, incidental, or consequential damages, including loss of use, loss of time, inconvenience, diminution in value, or commercial loss.",
    "The 2023 Proposal states that downtime estimates are not a contractual commitment and may be adjusted depending on the final induction schedule, mutually agreed facility, and availability. If additional work is required, downtime may be extended.",
    "Georgia law implies a 'reasonable time' for performance when a contract is silent on the matter of completion deadlines.",
    "Contractual limitations on damages are generally valid under Georgia law, unless they purport to relieve liability for gross negligence or willful or wanton conduct.",
    "Gulfstream warrants previous work for 12 months or 1,000 hours of flight time, with the sole remedy for defects being repair or replacement. Gulfstream's sole warranty obligation for negligent or otherwise defective inspection activities, including damage caused by negligent failure to identify a defect, is also mentioned."
