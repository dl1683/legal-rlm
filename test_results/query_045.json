  "hypothesis": "The timeline of expert report submissions will primarily be established by formal **arbitrator or court orders** (scheduling orders or case management orders) setting initial deadlines. These deadlines may have been subsequently modified by motions to extend or by stipulations between the parties. The actual submission dates will be found on the filed expert reports themselves, or on accompanying certificates of service, and potentially corroborated by discovery responses or pre-hearing briefs.",
  "final_output": "**MEMORANDUM**\n\n**TO:** Senior Partner\n**FROM:** [Your Name]\n**DATE:** October 26, 2023\n**RE:** Timeline of Expert Report Submissions; *Channel IT Isle of Man Ltd. v. Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation*, No. G-24-115-AA\n\n***\n\n### **Executive Summary**\n\nThe timeline for expert report submissions was governed by the Tribunal's October 23, 2024 Scheduling Order, which established the procedure for expert discovery. The actual submissions occurred in Spring 2025, with Claimant CITIOM submitting its technical and damages reports on March 21 and April 4, respectively, followed by Respondent Gulfstream's rebuttal report on April 21, 2025. While the dates of the reports are well-documented, the specific deadlines mandated by the Scheduling Order are not present in the available evidence.\n\n### **Factual Background**\n\nThis arbitration, commenced by Claimant Channel IT Isle of Man Ltd. (“CITIOM”) on May 31, 2024, concerns maintenance and repair work performed by Respondent Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (“Gulfstream”) [Claimant CITIOM Pre-Hearing Brief - Apr 14 2025 (1).pdf, p. 2, UNVERIFIED]. Following Gulfstream’s Notice of Defense and Counterclaim on August 7, 2024, and CITIOM’s Amended Statement of Claim on September 9, 2024, the Tribunal held a preliminary hearing [Claimant CITIOM Pre-Hearing Brief - Apr 14 2025 (1).pdf, p. 2, UNVERIFIED].\n\nOn October 23, 2024, the Tribunal issued a “Report of Preliminary Hearing and Scheduling Order” (the “Scheduling Order”) [Claimant CITIOM Pre-Hearing Brief - Apr 14 2025 (1).pdf, p. 2, UNVERIFIED]. This order stipulated that the parties must first notify the Arbitrators of their intent to present expert witnesses, after which the Arbitrators would set a specific schedule for expert discovery [Report of Preliminary Hearing and Scheduling Order (002).docx, p. 1, UNVERIFIED].\n\nPursuant to this framework, the parties exchanged expert reports in the spring of 2025. CITIOM submitted a technical report from Danny Farnham dated March 21, 2025, and a damages report from FAZ Forensics dated April 4, 2025 [No Exhibits - CITIOM v. Gulfstream-FAZ Report copy.pdf, p. 7, UNVERIFIED; CITIOM v. Gulfstream-FAZ Report.pdf, p. 1, UNVERIFIED]. Subsequently, Gulfstream submitted a rebuttal expert report from Leonard A. Beauchemin dated April 21, 2025, which directly addresses the findings of the Farnham report [CITIOM v. Gulfstream - LB Expert Rebuttal Report (4-21-25).pdf, p. 1-2, UNVERIFIED].\n\n### **Analysis**\n\n#### **Key Findings**\n\n*   The procedural framework for expert submissions was established by the Tribunal’s October 23, 2024 Scheduling Order, which required parties to first declare their intent to use experts before specific deadlines were set. [Report of Preliminary Hearing and Scheduling Order (002).docx, p. 1, UNVERIFIED].\n*   Claimant CITIOM submitted two affirmative expert reports:\n    *   **D. Farnham Expert Report (Technical):** Dated March 21, 2025 [NO exhibits - CITIOM EXPERT REPORT - D. Farnham Expert Report - Mar 21 2025 copy.pdf, p. 2, UNVERIFIED].\n    *   **FAZ Forensics Report (Damages):** Dated April 4, 2025 [CITIOM v. Gulfstream-FAZ Report.pdf, p. 1, UNVERIFIED].\n*   Respondent Gulfstream submitted one rebuttal expert report:\n    *   **Leonard A. Beauchemin Expert Rebuttal Report:** Dated April 21, 2025, prepared specifically to review and respond to the Farnham report [CITIOM v. Gulfstream - LB Expert Rebuttal Report (4-21-25).pdf, p. 2, UNVERIFIED].\n\n#### **Supporting Evidence**\n\nThe chronology and purpose of the expert reports are well-supported by the available documents, despite many being unverified. The existence and date of the governing Scheduling Order are referenced in CITIOM’s Pre-Hearing Brief [Claimant CITIOM Pre-Hearing Brief - Apr 14 2025 (1).pdf, p. 2, UNVERIFIED].\n\nThe dates of the expert reports are consistently referenced across multiple sources. For instance, the FAZ Forensics report dated April 4, 2025, explicitly cites and relies upon the \"Expert Report of D. Farnham dated March 21, 2025\" [No Exhibits - CITIOM v. Gulfstream-FAZ Report copy.pdf, p. 7, UNVERIFIED]. Similarly, Gulfstream's rebuttal report from Leonard A. Beauchemin, dated April 21, 2025, states that he was \"asked by counsel to review the expert report prepared by Danny Farnham\" [CITIOM v. Gulfstream - LB Expert Rebuttal Report (4-21-25).pdf, p. 2, UNVERIFIED]. This confirms the sequence of submissions: Farnham (March 21), FAZ (April 4), and Beauchemin (April 21).\n\n#### **Contradictions or Concerns**\n\nThe primary concern is the unverified status of nearly all cited documents. The core procedural document, the Scheduling Order, has not been reviewed in its complete form. Excerpts indicate the *process* for setting deadlines but do not contain the actual deadline dates themselves, as one key passage contains a blank space where a date was to be inserted [Report of Preliminary Hearing and scheduling Order (002).docx, p. 1, UNVERIFIED]. Therefore, while we have established the dates the reports were finalized, we cannot confirm their timeliness relative to the Tribunal's ordered schedule.\n\n#### **Evidence Strength Assessment**\n\n**Moderate.** The evidence for the *actual submission timeline* is consistent and corroborated across multiple documents, which lends it credibility. The sequence of initial reports followed by a rebuttal is logical and supported by the content of the rebuttal report itself. However, the overall strength is limited to \"Moderate\" because the primary source document defining the *required* timeline—the full Scheduling Order—is unverified and incomplete in the materials provided.\n\n### **Entities & Relationships**\n\n*   **Claimant:** Channel IT Isle of Man Ltd. (CITIOM)\n*   **Respondent:** Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation\n*   **Arbitral Tribunal:** John A. Sherrill, Glenn P. Hendrix, and Robert W. Murphy\n*   **Claimant's Experts:**\n    *   **Danny Farnham:** Technical Expert\n    *   **FAZ Forensics (Michael S. Brown):** Damages Expert, retained by Watson Farley & Williams LLP [CITIOM v. Gulfstream-FAZ Report.pdf, p. 2, UNVERIFIED]\n*   **Respondent's Expert:**\n    *   **Leonard A. Beauchemin:** Rebuttal Technical Expert\n\n### **Gaps & Limitations**\n\n*   **Evidence NOT Found:** The complete and verified \"Report of Preliminary Hearing and Scheduling Order\" dated October 23, 2024. This document is critical as it contains the specific deadlines against which the actual submission dates must be measured.\n*   **Areas Needing Further Investigation:** The case file should be reviewed for any motions to extend expert deadlines, stipulations between the parties modifying the schedule, or subsequent orders from the Tribunal that may have altered the original timeline.\n*   **Limitations of Available Documents:** The analysis is contingent on excerpts and references within secondary documents. Without the primary Scheduling Order, it is impossible to assess compliance with the Tribunal's directives. Furthermore, the dates on the reports may not reflect the official date of service on opposing counsel.\n\n### **Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Immediate Actions:** Prioritize locating and obtaining a complete, verified copy of the \"Report of Preliminary Hearing and Scheduling Order\" dated October 23, 2024, to ascertain the specific, mandated deadlines for expert reports.\n2.  **Additional Investigation:** Review the full case docket and all correspondence to identify any orders or party stipulations that may have amended the initial scheduling deadlines. Certificates of service for each expert report should also be located to confirm the exact date of submission.\n3.  **Risk Mitigation:** Once the deadlines are confirmed, assess whether all submissions were timely. If any submission was late, determine whether the opposing party objected and evaluate any potential arguments regarding waiver or prejudice.",
