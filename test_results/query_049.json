  "hypothesis": "The query seeks a comprehensive, chronological account of all changes to core contract(s) between CITIOM and Gulfstream, particularly concerning repairs and warranty coverage for aircraft GS550-5174. This includes formal amendments and *operational adjustments/delays* to the scope of work (e.g., procurement of used parts, extensive evaluation periods, rework for damages) that significantly impacted incurred hours and costs. The timeline needs to reconcile these changes against the terms of any structural warranty and specific repair agreements, and understand their impact on aircraft availability and associated damages. Current evidence highlights significant operational delays and material procurement challenges related to duct repairs between July and October 2024, contributing to extended man-hours.",
  "final_output": "**MEMORANDUM**\n\n**TO:** Senior Managing Partner\n**FROM:** [Your Name/ID], Senior Partner\n**DATE:** October 26, 2023\n**RE:** Timeline and Analysis of Contract Modifications; CITIOM v. Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, Case No. G-24-115-AA\n\n---\n\n### **Executive Summary**\nThe timeline of agreements between CITIOM and Gulfstream reveals few formal, written amendments to the core maintenance contract for aircraft GS550-5174. Instead, the contract's scope, cost, and schedule were significantly altered by a series of *de facto* modifications arising from operational challenges, including unforeseen repairs and material procurement delays. These operational adjustments, rather than signed amendments, form the crux of the dispute, with the parties contesting whether such changes fall under the original proposal's contingencies or constitute a breach of warranty and misrepresentation.\n\n### **Factual Background**\nThe relationship between CITIOM and Gulfstream concerning aircraft GS550-5174 has been punctuated by several key events that effectively modified the scope and cost of work performed. The following chronology is based on the evidence gathered.\n\n*   **February 2020 (Implied):** During an inspection, corrosion was discovered on the aircraft's wing-to-body fairings, necessitating removal and evaluation. This event represents an early, unforeseen addition to a planned workscope.\n*   **May 11, 2020:** An email confirmed that the corrosion issue was approved for \"continued airworthiness from engineering,\" and the panels would be primed and painted.\n*   **August 16, 2020 (Implied):** A new aircraft frame was scheduled for delivery to address the corrosion issue, a solution anticipated to be \"less labor intensive and quicker than repair.\"\n*   **August–October 2020:** The new frame required \"extensive modification\" due to misaligned pilot holes, resulting in \"hundreds of hours of labor\" and a \"huge negative impact to schedule.\" The issue, first identified in February, was not completed until October, representing a nine-month operational delay and a significant deviation from the planned repair.\n*   **Circa 2023:** Gulfstream provided CITIOM a proposal for the 192-month inspection with a quoted workscope cost of $835,931 [CITIOM Amended Statement of Claim.pdf, p. 3; CITIOM Statement of Claim.pdf, p. 3]. This proposal included an estimate of 2,800 man-hours and a 35-45 business day downtime [CITIOM Amended Statement of Claim.pdf, p. 3]. Crucially, the proposal stated that the estimate did not include costs or downtime for correcting discrepancies found during the inspection [Gulfstream - Prehearing Brief .pdf, p. 2].\n*   **July–October 2024:** The working hypothesis indicates this period was marked by significant operational delays and material procurement challenges related to duct repairs, which contributed to extended man-hours. Evidence confirms Gulfstream located and purchased a \"used duct\" that was not immediately serviceable, requiring additional work [NO exhibits - CITIOM EXPERT REPORT - D. Farnham Expert Report - Mar 21 2025 copy.pdf, p. 20] [UNVERIFIED]; [PDF 2 - EXPERT WITNESS REPORT March 5 copy.pdf, p. 15] [UNVERIFIED].\n*   **On or after April 10, 2024:** A draft Asset Purchase Agreement (APA), whose direct connection to the maintenance dispute is not fully established, was amended. The redlined draft removed \"interior works wording\" and incorporated other changes [331-463.pdf, p. 8] [UNVERIFIED]. A subsequent amendment to Section 8.2 of the APA required CITIOM's client to reimburse Gulfstream's client USD 1.6 million for \"interior works\" and pay a USD 500,000 penalty.\n*   **On or around May 5, 2025:** A Letter of Intent (LOI) in \"agreed form\" required an amendment to name Mr. Fernando Oliveira Lima as the correct purchaser. A revised LOI also included an \"estimate of the modification costs to be USD 70K.\"\n\n### **Analysis**\n\n#### **Key Findings**\n1.  **Written Modification Requirement:** The parties’ Confidentiality Agreement explicitly stipulates that it \"cannot be modified, amended, or waived other than by a writing agreed to by the parties.\" [CITIOM v. GAC - Confidentiality Agreement and Proposed Protective Order.pdf, p. 20] [UNVERIFIED]. While this applies to the Confidentiality Agreement itself, it reflects a contractual environment where formal changes are expected to be documented in writing.\n2.  **Absence of Formal Amendments to Workscope:** The available evidence does not contain formal, signed amendments or change orders related to the 192-month inspection workscope. The modifications appear to be operational adjustments and expansions of work driven by emergent technical issues.\n3.  **Operational Scope Creep is Central to Dispute:** The timeline is defined by significant, unplanned work—most notably the 2020 frame modification and the 2024 duct repair. These events dramatically altered the cost, labor hours, and downtime, thereby serving as *de facto* modifications to the original agreement.\n4.  **Original Contract Terms are Contested:** Gulfstream’s defense rests on the assertion that its proposal explicitly excluded repair costs and downtime from the initial estimate [Gulfstream - Prehearing Brief .pdf, p. 2]. CITIOM counters that this proposal was misleading, forming the basis of its claim for fraudulent and negligent mishandling [Claimant CITIOM Pre-Hearing Brief - Apr 14 2025 (1).pdf, p. 1] [UNVERIFIED].\n\n#### **Supporting Evidence**\nThe strongest evidence of the parties’ conflicting interpretations of the contract and its modifications comes from their respective pre-hearing briefs. Gulfstream’s brief repeatedly cites the proposal’s language: \"...the proposal states that the estimate provided does not include the cost or downtime to correct any discrepancies...\" [Gulfstream - Prehearing Brief .pdf, p. 2].\n\nConversely, CITIOM’s claim of misrepresentation is supported by the stark contrast between the initial estimate ($835,931 for 2,800 man-hours) and the eventual outcome, which involved an estimate climbing to USD 1.6 million and a service period extending from January 29 to November 29, 2024 [CITIOM Amended Statement of Claim.pdf, p. 3; Mike Brown (FAZ) Direct Outline with Redirect & Rehab.docx, p. 1] [UNVERIFIED]. The 2020 frame repair, which took nine months to resolve a single issue, serves as a powerful factual predicate for CITIOM's arguments regarding systemic delays and mismanagement.\n\n#### **Contradictions or Concerns**\nThe evidence details amendments to an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) and a Letter of Intent (LOI) occurring in 2024 and 2025. These documents reference a USD 1.6 million payment and other transactional details. It is unclear if these agreements are related to a potential settlement of the maintenance dispute or an entirely separate transaction involving the aircraft. Their relevance cannot be confirmed without further context. Additionally, the high volume of unverified citations is a significant concern.\n\n#### **Evidence Strength Assessment**\n**Rating: Moderate**\n\nThe evidence base is sufficient to construct a coherent narrative of the dispute and understand the core arguments of both parties. The working hypothesis is well-supported by expert reports and legal filings. However, the overall strength is limited by a heavy reliance on unverified secondary sources (e.g., expert reports summarizing events) rather than primary contractual documents (e.g., the proposal itself, signed work orders, or formal amendments). The few verified documents primarily represent Gulfstream's position.\n\n### **Entities & Relationships**\n*   **CITIOM (Channel IT Isle of Man Ltd.):** The Claimant and owner/operator of aircraft GS550-5174.\n*   **Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (GAC):** The Respondent and maintenance provider responsible for the 192-month inspection and subsequent repairs.\n*   **Mr. Fernando Oliveira Lima:** Identified as the purchaser in an amended Letter of Intent. His role in the primary dispute is undefined.\n\n### **Gaps & Limitations**\n*   **Missing Primary Documents:** The investigation lacks the original signed proposal for the 192-month inspection, the governing Work Authorization Agreement, and any formal, signed change orders. These documents are essential to definitively assess the contractual baseline.\n*   **Unverified Evidence:** A significant portion of the citations (80 out of 87) could not be verified from the provided file paths, creating a risk that context or precise wording may be inaccurate.\n*   **Ambiguous APA/LOI Context:** The purpose of the amended Asset Purchase Agreement and Letter of Intent, and their connection to the maintenance contract dispute, is unknown.\n*   **Lack of Communication Records:** There is a lack of emails, meeting minutes, or other communications that would clarify how operational changes (like the duct repair) were proposed, negotiated, and approved by the parties in real-time.\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1.  **Immediate Actions:**\n    *   Issue immediate discovery requests for all primary contractual documents, including the fully executed 192-month inspection proposal, its associated terms and conditions, and any subsequent signed Work Authorizations or Change Orders.\n    *   Initiate a process to verify the documents cited in the key expert reports (Farnham, FAZ, LB).\n\n2.  **Additional Investigation:**\n    *   Depose the key technical and managerial personnel from both CITIOM and Gulfstream who were involved in the 2020 frame repair and the 2024 duct procurement. The objective is to establish the facts regarding communication, approval processes, and cost/schedule impact discussions for these operational modifications.\n    *   Investigate the nature of the Asset Purchase Agreement and Letter of Intent to determine their relevance, specifically whether they pertain to a settlement of this dispute.\n\n3.  **Risk Mitigation:**\n    *   Develop legal arguments to address Gulfstream's reliance on its proposal's exclusionary language. Potential theories include fraudulent inducement, waiver by course of conduct, or that the magnitude of the discrepancies exceeded any reasonable contingency contemplated by the contract.\n    *   Continue to work with our experts to clearly separate and quantify damages resulting from (a) legitimate, unforeseen repairs, (b) work covered under warranty, and (c) delays caused by Gulfstream's alleged mismanagement.",

    "The initial Gulfstream proposal quoted 2,800 manhours / 35-45 business days.",
    "The final actual scope in labor hours exceeded 26,000 hours.",
    "Corrosion was found in repeated areas such as the horizontal stabilizer, forward fuselage frame, and APU access door.",
    "These corroded areas were previously worked on during the 144-month or July 2023 visits.",
    "Gulfstream allegedly deployed new data analytics in July 2023, but did not update its proposal.",
    "Gulfstream's parent company, General Dynamics, used discrepancy estimates in Jet Aviation proposals.",
    "The document references a 'complex procurement and repair of an unserviceable used duct'.",
    "The 20-year structural warranty is mentioned as a point of reconciliation.",
    "An initial repair estimate for the aircraft was $642,000 US dollars, with an estimated Return To Service (RTS) of 6-8 weeks.",
    "The estimated cost for the aircraft repairs subsequently increased to $1.6 million US dollars.",
    "A client (represented by Mr. Haider) expressed significant frustration regarding the cost increase from $642,000 to $1.6 million, describing it as 'ridiculous' and 'incompetent'.",
    "The client specifically asked Gulfstream to limit the cost overrun to a maximum of $1.6 million.",
    "Return To Service (RTS) was expected on '24.4' (likely April 24th), coinciding with the $1.6 million estimate.",
    "The client demanded the return of the aircraft before '31st of March'.",
    "The client acknowledged that Gulfstream keeps Avcon informed 'very promptly' regarding additional costs.",
    "Damages figures presented by Mike Brown (FAZ) include €1.6 million in lost profit and €814,000 in alternate transport, totaling €2.4 million.",
    "Mike Brown (FAZ) is 'extremely confident' that the aircraft would have generated €1.6 million in net profit, consistent with 2022–2023 earnings and industry utilization norms.",
    "The expert's analysis focuses on lost charter income and alternative transportation expenses.",
    "The damages figure is €2.4 million total: €1.6M in lost profit + €814k in alternate transport.",
    "Lost charter income was calculated using Avcon Jet reports from 2022–2024.",
    "The 'but-for' world assumed Return to Service (RTS) on April 1, 2024, as quoted by Gulfstream.",
    "Alternate transportation costs amounted to €814,067 incurred by CITIOM for replacement transportation.",
    "Alternate transportation costs were based on actual invoices and receipts provided by Avcon Jet and CITIOM’s accounting team.",
    "The damages model excludes categories like reputational harm, lost sale, direct repair costs, and warranty disputes.",
    "The assumption of RTS on April 1, 2024, is based on Gulfstream's written commitment.",
    "The €2.4 million damages figure may actually understate the full impact because certain categories of loss were excluded.",
    "The RTS estimate of April 1, 2024, came from Gulfstream's June 2023 proposal, based on their quoted downtime of 35–45 business days.",
    "Michael Brown is a Damages Expert for FAZ Forensics.",
    "Brown has 40 years of experience in forensic accounting and litigation consulting and holds CPA, CFE, and CFF certifications.",
    "Brown was retained to assess economic harm to CITIOM due to Gulfstream's extended delays in the 192-month inspection.",
    "Brown was instructed to assume Gulfstream is responsible for the delays and that CITIOM would prevail on liability.",
    "The analysis focused on the period of Jan 29 – Nov 29, 2024, for the aircraft being out of service during the 192-month inspection.",
    "Damages evaluated include lost charter profit and additional out-of-pocket travel costs.",
    "The total economic damages concluded by Brown are €2,427,242: €1,613,175 in lost financial contribution and €814,067 in replacement transportation expenses.",
    "Warranty or rework costs were excluded from the figure.",
    "Estimates were described as conservative, excluding reputational loss, diminution in resale value, or failed sale damages.",
    "Lost charter profit was calculated using Avcon Jet monthly reports for 2022–2024 (usage, revenue, margins).",
    "The 'but-for' world assumed a Return-to-Service (RTS) of April 1, 2024, based on Gulfstream’s original quote of 35–45 working days.",
    "A typical usage cadence (70% of hours attributable to charter business) was applied, not a full booking schedule.",
    "Lost charter profit was calculated on a contribution profit basis (revenue less direct operating expenses).",
    "Additional out-of-pocket costs of €814,067 were incurred for alternative travel and logistics (charter rentals, repositioning, standby crew, etc.).",
    "These costs were substantiated by actual invoices and accounting records from CITIOM and Avcon Jet.",
    "Crew salaries were not fully included, as they were partially mitigated by reductions and freelance flexibility.",
    "Canceled hangar or airport contracts were not included in this calculation, as they were considered mitigated separately.",
    "Brown's work was a forensic damages assessment per AICPA guidelines, not a GAAS or GAAP audit.",
    "Calculations are traceable from underlying records, with figures linked to schedules and source documents in appendices.",
    "No damages were attributed to loss of aircraft sale, goodwill, or reputational damage.",
    "Gulfstream's own June 2023 proposal estimated 35–45 working days of downtime, aligning with an April 1, 2024 RTS date.",

    "On July 5, several air ducts from aircraft SN 5174 were sent to Savannah by Gulfstream for evaluation and repair due to corrosion found at connection flanges.",
    "From the second week in July to the second week in September, Gulfstream evaluated and determined that one specific duct from the ground air start system could not be repaired.",
    "A new ground air start duct was not available from Gulfstream's supply chain, necessitating the search for a serviceable used duct.",
    "A used duct was eventually located and purchased by Gulfstream, but it was not initially in serviceable condition and required repair.",
    "The located used duct was repaired, certified, and shipped to St. Louis for installation.",
    "On October 8, 2024, the repaired and certified used duct was installed on aircraft SN 5174.",
    "The entire process for the ground air start duct (evaluation, determination, locating replacement, repairing used duct, shipping, and installation) took approximately three months.",

    "Gulfstream covered the cost of several rework items resulting from damage created during other work (e.g., damaged flight control cable, LH Fixed engine cowl, LH inboard spoiler, wing torque link fittings, APU inlet/installation rework). These rework items consumed additional man-hours and negatively impacted the schedule.",
    "The used duct was repaired, certified, shipped to St Louis, and installed on aircraft SN 5174 on October 8, 2024.",
    "The process to evaluate, determine unrepairability, locate a replacement (new unavailable), locate a used duct, repair the used duct, and ship it for installation took approximately three months.",

    "Warranty work is claimed to account for 55% of the man-hours spent on the inspection of the aircraft.",
    "Gulfstream's Defense claims that the increase in expected downtime from 35-45 Working Days (2023 Proposal) to approximately 160 working days was due to repairs for discrepancies (including corrosion) discovered during maintenance, which were not included in the original Proposal.",
    "The St. Louis Service Center was selected to perform the 192-month inspection.",
    "The 192-month inspection requires substantial disassembly of the aircraft's interior and exterior.",
    "Gulfstream acknowledges that the level of disassembly for the 192-month inspection was known prior to beginning repairs, and thus, not the cause of unpredictable delays.",
    "Corrosion repair is a time and manpower-intensive process involving grinding, measuring, submitting to engineers, and engineering approval.",
    "Gulfstream's 20-year structural warranty covers costs associated with structural repairs due to structural corrosion.",
    "Gulfstream claims 9,822 hours are allocated to warranty work for corrosion and structural discrepancies, representing 55% of man-hours spent on the inspection.",
    "Gulfstream states its warranty covers structural repairs but not the removal of minor corrosion, considered standard maintenance. Gulfstream determines warranty coverage.",
    "The Gulfstream Work Authorization Terms and Conditions (T&C) contain an exclusion of damages clause (Section 8) prohibiting punitive, special, incidental, or consequential damages, including loss of use, loss of time, inconvenience, diminution in value, or commercial loss.",
    "The Proposal states that estimated downtime is not a contractual commitment and may be adjusted depending on the final induction schedule, mutually agreed facility, and if additional work is required.",
    "Georgia law implies a 'reasonable time' for performance when a contract is silent on the matter.",
    "Contractual limitations on damages are generally valid under Georgia law, unless they purport to relieve liability for gross negligence or willful/wanton conduct.",
    "Gulfstream warranties previous work for 12 months or 1,000 hours of flight time, with the sole remedy being repair or replacement.",
    "Leonard A. Beauchemin was retained by counsel for Gulfstream to serve as an expert in this arbitration.",
    "Beauchemin was asked to review the expert report prepared by Danny Farnham and documents relating to the 192-month inspection of the G550 S/N 5174 aircraft.",
    "Beauchemin's opinions include that the Farnham report misconstrues roles of owner/operator vs. OEM/MRO, misstates industry standards for MRO proposal information, and that the Gulfstream proposal for the 192-month inspection is not 'misleading'.",
    "Beauchemin states the Farnham report is incorrect in claiming earlier corrosion findings should have predicted extensive corrosion at the 192-month inspection and offers no evidence for claims of improper inspection/correction during the 144-month inspection.",
    "Beauchemin notes it's common for MROs to move technicians between aircraft during extended maintenance and to use other facilities/vendors.",
    "Beauchemin has forty-two years of business jet aircraft maintenance and management experience, including roles from technician to VP of maintenance.",
    "Beauchemin worked for nine years at Bombardier MRO, overseeing heavy inspection, structural repair, and modifications on similar class airframes.",
    "Beauchemin has managed and procured proposals for hundreds of business jet aircraft inspections and modifications across numerous MRO facilities, including Gulfstream.",
    "Beauchemin served as Chairperson of the Maintenance Committee of the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA).",

    "Beauchemin served for a period on the Gulfstream committee responsible for developing the maintenance program for the GV (G550) aircraft.",
    "Beauchemin was a member on an FAA Advisory Rule Making Committee responsible for rewriting and developing new standards for aircraft reliability programs (AC 120-17A).",
    "Beauchemin's opinions are based on his review of the Farnham report and documents relating to the 192-month inspection of the G550 S/N 5174 aircraft.",
    "CITIOM commenced this Arbitration on May 31, 2024, pursuant to the dispute resolution provision contained in the Proposal.",
    "Respondent Gulfstream filed a Notice of Defense and Counterclaim dated August 7, 2024.",
    "Gulfstream prepared and presented the Customer Support Proposal dated 02 June 2023 (the \"Proposal\", CIT00001 – CIT00028) for the 192-month inspection of the Aircraft.",
    "The Proposal's Estimated Downtime section states: \"Any downtime estimates included in this Proposal are based upon Gulfstream’s general understanding of the time required to accomplish the work outlined in this Proposal. Estimated downtime may be adjusted depending on the final induction schedule and mutually agreed facility selected for completion of the Work. For the avoidance of doubt, any expression of downtime is only provided as an estimate. This estimate is not a contractual commitment by Gulfstream.\"",
    "Addendum to Proposal and Work Authorization Terms and Conditions – Interior Refurbishment Warranty: The duration of Gulfstream’s warranty for interior refurbishment... is twenty-four (24) months or twelve hundred (1200) flight hours (whichever comes first) for craftsmanship associated with interior refurbishments, exclusive of wear and tear, abuse or accident.",
    "The Aircraft was ultimately returned to service in November 2024 (nearly nine months after the estimated return to service date).",
    "The Proposal quoted a workscope cost of $835,931, in addition to certain other items to be assessed during input.",
    "Gulfstream estimated 2,800 manhours were required for the 192-month inspection, with an initial downtime of 35-45 business days.",
    "Gulfstream projected a return to service date of April 1, 2024, if the Aircraft was input on January 29, 2024.",
    "CITIOM agreed to the Proposal relying on Gulfstream's express representations and believing them to be made in good faith.",
    "Gulfstream introduced new data collection and analytical capabilities in July 2023.",
    "In April 2024, Gulfstream conceded the original work order quoted 2,800 manhours and advised the estimated completion date would be June 21st.",
    "CITIOM asserted that several issues Gulfstream claimed to discover should have been previously identified during earlier maintenance events or resulted from Gulfstream's own ineffective repairs.",
    "Gulfstream claimed a need to replace leading edges due to corrosion, but CITIOM argued this should have been addressed during the July-August 2023 maintenance.",
    "During the July Maintenance, Gulfstream removed and reinstalled the APU, addressed corrosion on the fuselage side under the exhaust shield, but not the APU enclosure access door frame, which Gulfstream has now identified for repair.",
    "There were serious concerns about additional delays caused by required replacements that did not align with expectations.",
    "Questions regarding the LBL 30.50 floor beam angle cap replacement remained unanswered, and previously uncommunicated options for repair were identified.",
    "Issues related to replacements were 'only being investigated after our interventions', implying a reactive rather than proactive approach to addressing problems.",
    "Communication was challenging, with one party not being informed about the holiday schedule of the 'STM' or any appointed deputies.",
    "On July 5, [implicitly 2024, based on subsequent dates], several air ducts, including one from the ground air start system, were sent to Savannah for evaluation and repair due to corrosion found at connection flanges, as Gulfstream reportedly lacked internal capability to assess or repair them.",
    "From the second week of July to the second week of September [2024], Gulfstream spent approximately two months evaluating the ground air start system duct, eventually determining it could not be repaired.",
    "A used duct was eventually located and purchased by Gulfstream, but it was not initially in serviceable condition and required additional repair, certification, and shipping to St. Louis.",
    "The repaired and certified used duct for SN 5174 was installed on October 8, 2024.",
    "The entire process for the ground air start duct (evaluation, determination, procurement of unavailable new part, location/repair of used part, shipping, and installation) took approximately three months (July to October 2024), described as 'complex, cumbersome and very inefficient'.",
    "Additional 'damage and rework' occurred due to 'poor workmanship, lack of experience/training, and possibly carelessness', for which Gulfstream covered the cost, but which resulted in 'many additional manhours of labor' and a 'negative impact on the schedule'.",
    "Examples of rework include: damaged flight control cable, damaged LH Fixed engine cowl, damaged LH inboard spoiler, damaged wing torque link fittings, damaged APU inlet, and APU re-installation due to misalignment of the inlet duct.",
    "Gulfstream claims to have incurred 9,822 hours, representing 55% of the man-hours spent on inspection, allocated to warranty work addressing corrosion and other structural discrepancies on GS550-5174.",
    "CITIOM objects to Request No. 1 on grounds of being overbroad, seeking documents unrelated to the current dispute. CITIOM will produce flight logs for the Aircraft from July 2020 to present.",
    "CITIOM objects to Request No. 2 on grounds of being overbroad, requesting contracts and agreements unrelated to the current dispute. CITIOM advises that the Aircraft was not put into storage during the period 2018 to present.",
    "CITIOM objects to Request No. 3 on grounds of being overbroad, seeking documents about aircraft not the subject of this dispute. CITIOM will produce documents showing the number and model of the Bombardier CL-600-2B16 Challenger 605, serial number 5745, owned by Mr. Haidar.",
    "CITIOM objects to Request No. 4 on grounds of being overbroad, seeking documents about aircraft and companies not the subject of this dispute. CITIOM agrees to produce Mr. Farnham’s curriculum vitae and documents showing the number and model of Gulfstream Aircraft that Avcon has managed since July 2020.",
    "CITIOM objects to Request No. 5 on grounds of being overbroad, seeking documents unrelated to the current dispute and on the grounds that proposals for maintenance are in Gulfstream’s possession.",
    "CITIOM agrees to produce documents responsive to Request No. 6 (corrosion repair by non-Gulfstream entities) and not in the possession, custody, or control of Gulfstream, which performed all regular maintenance.",
    "CITIOM objects to Request No. 7 on grounds it seeks privileged documents and documents in Gulfstream’s possession. CITIOM agrees to produce non-privileged documents responsive to internal/external communications related to the quoting, scheduling, and induction of the Aircraft for the 192-month inspection at the Gulfstream St. Louis Service Center.",
    "CITIOM objects to Request No. 8 on grounds it seeks privileged documents and documents in Gulfstream’s possession. CITIOM agrees to produce responsive documents related to internal/external communications among Channel IT, Avcon, Danny Farnham, Ben Schouten, and any Gulfstream representatives regarding the Aircraft's 192-month inspection, downtime, and estimated cost.",
    "CITIOM agrees to produce documents responsive to Request No. 9, if any, concerning internal/external communications among Channel IT, Avcon, Danny Farnham, Ben Schouten, with other Gulfstream customers related to downtime or cost of prior maintenance visits at Gulfstream facilities.",
    "CITIOM agrees to produce documents responsive to Request No. 10, showing the nature, amount, and basis for each form of damages Channel IT seeks.",
    "CITIOM objects to Request No. 11 on grounds it seeks attorney-client privileged communications. CITIOM agrees to produce non-privileged documents concerning responsibility of Avcon, Danny Farnham, or Ben Schouten in relation to any aspect of the 192-month inspection, including correspondence involving legal counsel.",
    "CITIOM refers to Response No. 10 for Requests No. 12, 13, and 14 concerning lost profits and loss of use damages.",
