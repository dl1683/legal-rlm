I first met Mr. Farnham in connection with the sale of the Challenger aircraft, and have known him for about seven years. He has also assisted me in connection with other aircraft maintenance events, including the 144-month inspection of this Aircraft at Gulfstream Savannah. I trust his expertise and diligence.\n\n[Bassim Draft Witness Statement.docx, p.1]\nIn summary, CITIOM entrusted its Aircraft to Gulfstream, the OEM, for a major inspection based on a proposal that proved to be grossly misleading in terms of cost and downtime. Gulfstream failed to utilize its own data and expertise to provide a realistic estimate, failed to properly manage the project, suffered from significant staffing and efficiency issues at its St. Louis facility, failed to adequately address corrosion issues from prior maintenance, and ultimately caused CITIOM significant financial and operational damages through extraordinary delays and cost overruns. Their failure to meet the repeatedly promised June 21, 2024 return date directly caused the collapse of a lucrative sale agreement, resulting in a further loss of approximately $1 million upon the eventual sale of the Aircraft.\n\n[Danny Farnham Direct Outline with Cross & Redirect.docx, p.1]\nWitness Role: Expert in Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) operations\n\n[Danny Farnham Direct Outline with Cross & Redirect.docx, p.1]\nI.
