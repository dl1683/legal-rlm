Bassim Haider Direct Outline with Redirect & Rehab.docx, p.1]\nTheme: Gulfstream misrepresented scope and timeline, failed to disclose critical forecasting tools, and caused millions in foreseeable losses.\n\n[1. Bassim Haider Direct Outline with Redirect & Rehab.docx, p.1]\nWhat decisions did you make in reliance on Gulfstream’s timeline assurances?\n\n[1. Bassim Haider Direct Outline with Redirect & Rehab.docx, p.1]\nWere you ever told that the quoted timeline excluded major discrepancy work?\n\n[1. Bassim Haider Direct Outline with Redirect & Rehab.docx, p.1]\nTheme: CITIOM relied on Gulfstream’s timeline and escalated concerns when delays became apparent.\n\n[4. Charles Philipp - Cross Exam & Impeachment .docx, p.1]\nStrong Contradiction: Gulfstream's proposal gave CITIOM a timeline less than half of the known historical average—and you had the internal data to know better.\n\n[4. Charles Philipp - Cross Exam & Impeachment .docx, p.1]\nIsn’t it true that your quote gave the customer a timeline that was grossly misleading?\n\n[4. Charles Philipp - Cross Exam & Impeachment .docx, p.1]\nYou had visibility into routing timelines?\n\n[Joe Rivera Outline #1.docx, p.1]\nWhat tracking mechanisms did he use to oversee critical project timelines and technician deployment?\n\n[Joe Rivera Outline #1.docx, p.1]\nQ: Would you agree that providing misleading timelines to the customer while deprioritizing their aircraft internally reflects a breakdown in management transparency?\n\n[Bassim Haider Direct Outline with Redirect & Rehab.docx, p.1]\nTheme: Mr. Haidar is an experienced, high-level international entrepreneur with decades of aviation and operational expertise.\n\n[Report of Preliminary Hearing and Scheduling Order (002).docx, p.1]\nExpert Discovery: The parties shall notify the Arbitrators on or before ________________ whether they will present any expert witnesses at the hearing. The Arbitrators shall set the schedule for expert discovery upon receiving notice of the presentation of expert witnesses from one or both parties.\n\n[Report of Preliminary Hearing and Scheduling Order (002).docx, p.1]\nDisclosures to the Arbitrators: Each counsel and party has a continuing obligation to protect the integrity of this arbitration proceeding by promptly providing the Arbitrators the information necessary to allow them to comply with their ongoing duties of disclosure. The parties and their counsel acknowledge their continuing obligation to supplement their disclosures of potential fact witnesses, expert witnesses, and any other individual or entity interested in the outcome of this arbitration proceeding. Any issues concerning disqualification of the Arbitrators should be raised promptly with CPR.\n\n[Closing Summary .docx, p.1]\nGulfstream’s own rebuttal expert never visited the facility. He never observed the work. He based his defense solely on internal documents and industry generalities. In contrast, CITIOM’s expert, Danny Farnham, was present on-site throughout the 10-month ordeal. He witnessed firsthand the mismanagement, the labor reassignments, the engineering indecision, and the chronic communication failures that defined this project.\n\n[Closing Summary .docx, p.1]\nThis Tribunal has heard ample evidence that CITIOM acted in good faith. It selected Gulfstream precisely because of its OEM expertise, its access to historical inspection data, and its warranty support. CITIOM reasonably believed Gulfstream would be transparent and professional. Instead, it was misled—and made to bear the full cost of Gulfstream’s silence.\n\n\n\nBased on document search, key findings:\n- Found relevant excerpts in repository documents\n- See excerpts above for specific citations\n",
