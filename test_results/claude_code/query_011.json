I later learned that Gulfstream had introduced new data analytics capabilities in July 2023, designed to provide more accurate historical cost and downtime information for major inspections. However, Gulfstream did not use this tool to update our Proposal before we signed it in September 2023, nor before the Aircraft was inputted in January 2024. They failed to provide us with the benefit of this improved data.\n\n[Bassim Draft Witness Statement.docx, p.1]\nGulfstream attempted to justify the delays and cost overruns by blaming unexpected corrosion findings and suggesting issues with the Aircraft's maintenance history or storage. I reject these excuses. As stated earlier, the Aircraft was well-maintained by Avcon, based at Farnborough (not a high-corrosion environment), washed regularly, and flown frequently (approx. 700 hours/year). Furthermore, Gulfstream, as the OEM with access to its own historical data and the specific maintenance history of this Aircraft (including the 144-month inspection and July 2023 work), should have anticipated the potential for corrosion and provided a realistic estimate from the outset. Their failure to do so, especially after introducing their new data analytics tool, constitutes a breach of their duty of care.\n\n[Charles Philipp Outline #1.docx, p.1]\nYou did not include discrepancy repair time or costs, despite Gulfstream’s historical experience with scope growth.\n\n[Charles Philipp Outline #1.docx, p.1]\nYou had access to Gulfstream historical maintenance records at the time?\n\n[Charles Philipp Outline #1.docx, p.1]\nDespite having historical data and newly developed analytics (July 2023), the quote was not revised.\n\n[2.
