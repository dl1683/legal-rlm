They failed to provide us with the benefit of this improved data.\n\n[Bassim Draft Witness Statement.docx, p.1]\nGulfstream attempted to justify the delays and cost overruns by blaming unexpected corrosion findings and suggesting issues with the Aircraft's maintenance history or storage. I reject these excuses. As stated earlier, the Aircraft was well-maintained by Avcon, based at Farnborough (not a high-corrosion environment), washed regularly, and flown frequently (approx. 700 hours/year). Furthermore, Gulfstream, as the OEM with access to its own historical data and the specific maintenance history of this Aircraft (including the 144-month inspection and July 2023 work), should have anticipated the potential for corrosion and provided a realistic estimate from the outset. Their failure to do so, especially after introducing their new data analytics tool, constitutes a breach of their duty of care.\n\n[Charles Philipp Outline #1.docx, p.1]\nYou did not include discrepancy repair time or costs, despite Gulfstream’s historical experience with scope growth.\n\n[Charles Philipp Outline #1.docx, p.1]\nYou had access to Gulfstream historical maintenance records at the time?\n\n[Charles Philipp Outline #1.docx, p.1]\nDespite having historical data and newly developed analytics (July 2023), the quote was not revised.\n\n[2.
