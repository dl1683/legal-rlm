I later learned that Gulfstream had introduced new data analytics capabilities in July 2023, designed to provide more accurate historical cost and downtime information for major inspections.

I reject these excuses. As stated earlier, the Aircraft was well-maintained by Avcon, based at Farnborough (not a high-corrosion environment), washed regularly, and flown frequently (approx. 700 hours/year). Furthermore, Gulfstream, as the OEM with access to its own historical data and the specific maintenance history of this Aircraft (including the 144-month inspection and July 2023 work), should have anticipated the potential for corrosion and provided a realistic estimate from the outset. Their failure to do so, especially after introducing their new data analytics tool, constitutes a breach of their duty of care.\n\n[2.
