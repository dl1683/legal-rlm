  "output": "I can give a preliminary review based on the limited fact summary in `run_codex_test.py`, but I don’t see the underlying case documents in this workspace. The scripts point to `C:\\Users\\devan\\Downloads\\CITIOM v Gulfstream\\documents`.\n\n**Preliminary Review**\n- **Known facts:** CITIOM’s G550 (SN 5174) underwent a 192‑month inspection starting 1/29/2024; estimate was $835,931 / 2,800 manhours / 35–45 business days; actual work ran 26,000+ manhours and completed 11/29/2024.\n- **Likely claims:** Negligent/fraudulent misrepresentation (estimate lacked reasonable basis), breach of contract (if estimate/time formed part of the bargain), and breach of good faith (if Gulfstream knew the estimate was unreliable).\n- **Core defenses:** Estimate treated as non‑binding forecast; scope expansion and unforeseen defects; CITIOM approvals or delays; contractual limitations on liability and consequential damages; lack of justifiable reliance on future cost/time.\n- **Evidence focus:** Customer Support Proposal Q‑11876 (6/2/2023), estimating worksheets/assumptions, internal communications and forecasting analytics, change orders, work logs, and the expert reports (Danny Farnham, Leonard B.).\n- **Damages considerations:** Reliance and downtime costs (replacement aircraft/lost use) vs. expectancy/overcharge theories; recovery will hinge on contract terms and causation tied to misrepresentation vs. legitimate scope discoveries.\n- **Key gaps:** Contract language on estimates, change‑order process, and limitation clauses; objective benchmarks for typical 192‑month inspection cost/time; timeline of when overrun became apparent and how it was communicated.\n\nIf you want a deeper review, I’ll need the case materials (proposal, communications, change orders, expert reports, pleadings). What deliverable do you want?\n\n1. Document‑cited case memo (issues/claims/defenses + liability assessment)  \n2. Evidence map with citation targets and gaps  \n3. Damages theory analysis (reliance vs. expectancy + limitation clauses)",
