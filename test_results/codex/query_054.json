The underlying case record does not appear in this workspace, and the scripts point to an external path (`C:\\Users\\devan\\Downloads\\CITIOM v Gulfstream\\documents`) that I cannot access here.\n\n**Preliminary review (limited record)**  \n- **Known facts:** CITIOM owns a Gulfstream G550 (SN 5174); Gulfstream performed a 192‑month inspection starting 2024‑01‑29; original estimate was $835,931 / 2,800 manhours / 35–45 business days; actual work exceeded 26,000 manhours and completed 2024‑11‑29; CITIOM claims the estimate was unreasonably low and misleading; key documents include Proposal Q‑11876 (2023‑06‑02) and expert reports from Danny Farnham and Leonard B.  \n- **Core liability questions:** Was the estimate a non‑binding forecast with enforceable disclaimers, or a commitment that had to be reasonably grounded? Did Gulfstream have contrary internal data at issuance and fail to update? Was CITIOM’s reliance reasonable and causally linked to specific losses?  \n- **Misrepresentation risk:** A large estimate‑to‑actual delta can support an inference of an unreasonable estimate, but liability hinges on proof of knowledge (or negligent lack of a reasonable basis) and whether updates were required once risks materialized.  \n- **Contract defenses:** Expect reliance on estimate/disclaimer language, change‑order and discrepancy terms, and arguments that scope expansion or aircraft condition caused the overrun.  \n- **Damages exposure:** Overrun costs and loss‑of‑use appear central; enforceability of limitation‑of‑liability and consequential‑damages exclusions will be pivotal.\n\n**Evidence priorities / gaps**  \n- The full text of Proposal Q‑11876 (assumptions, exclusions, disclaimer language).  \n- Governing contract terms (limitation‑of‑liability, consequential‑damages waiver, change‑order mechanics, governing law).  \n- Communications timeline on estimate revisions and return‑to‑service updates.  \n- Discrepancy logs, scope growth records, invoices, and manhour substantiation.  \n- Internal estimating data/analytics and staffing constraints in 2023–2024.  \n- Full expert reports and any depositions or cross‑exam outlines.\n\nIf you want a full, document‑cited memo, please point me to the case materials inside the workspace and the scope you want. Options:  \n1) Case brief + claims/defenses assessment  \n2) Evidence map with pinpoint cites and gaps  \n3) Damages and causation analysis  \n4) Timeline of estimate changes and communications",
