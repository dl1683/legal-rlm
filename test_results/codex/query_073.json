  "output": "Understood. Based on the case summary in `run_codex_test.py`, the baseline facts I have are:\n- CITIOM owns a Gulfstream G550 (SN 5174).\n- 192-month inspection began on 2024-01-29.\n- Original estimate: $835,931; 2,800 manhours; 35-45 business days.\n- Actual: 26,000+ manhours; completion on 2024-11-29.\n- CITIOM alleges the estimate was unreasonably low/misrepresented.\n- Key docs listed: Customer Support Proposal Q-11876 (2023-06-02) and expert reports (Danny Farnham; Leonard Beauchemin).\n\nWhat work product do you want next (case overview, issue-spotting memo, timeline, expert comparison, damages analysis, or answers to specific questions)? If you want me to cite primary documents, point me to their paths (the tests reference `C:\\Users\\devan\\Downloads\\CITIOM v Gulfstream\\documents`, but I have not opened anything outside the repo yet).",
