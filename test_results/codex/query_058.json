  "output": "**Findings**\n- Primary-record gap: The workspace does not contain the actual proposal Q-11876, Work Authorization T&Cs, pleadings, or expert reports; the available materials are summary outputs flagged unverified, so conclusions are provisional. `test_results/codex/query_055.json`, `test_results/query_001.json`, `test_results/query_043.json`.\n- Contractual limitation risk: Summaries report that downtime estimates are non-binding and that Section 8 of the T&Cs excludes consequential damages; if accurate, these clauses materially weaken reliance and loss-of-use recovery. `test_results/query_001.json`, `test_results/query_020.json`.\n- Causation/mitigation risk: Summaries note work stoppage tied to an unpaid interim invoice and possible approval delays, which may reduce or break causation. `test_results/query_043.json`.\n- Foreseeability proof gap: The misrepresentation theory relies on July 2023 analytics and historical St. Louis inspection data, but those records are not present. `test_results/query_001.json`, `test_results/query_043.json`.\n- Procedural timeline not fully verified: Key filing dates are consistent across summaries but are mostly secondary references. `test_results/query_020.json`.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- What governing law applies (summaries mention Georgia law), and do you have the choice-of-law and limitation clauses? `test_results/query_020.json`.\n- Can you provide the full Proposal Q-11876 and Work Authorization T&Cs, including addenda and warranty language? `test_results/query_001.json`.\n- Do we have primary records for July 2023 analytics or historical inspection durations at St. Louis? `test_results/query_001.json`.\n\n**Case Snapshot (Provisional)**\n- Parties/forum: CITIOM vs Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, CPR arbitration G-24-115-AA. `test_results/query_043.json`.\n- Aircraft and timing: G550 SN 5174; 192-month inspection at St. Louis; input Jan 29 2024; return around Nov 29 2024. `run_codex_test.py`, `test_results/query_043.json`.\n- Estimate vs actual: proposal Q-11876 dated June 2 2023; USD 835,931, 2,800 manhours, 35-45 business days, RTS April 1 2024; actual labor reported 26,000+ hours and repeated RTS slips. `run_codex_test.py`, `test_results/query_001.json`, `test_results/query_043.json`.\n- Procedure/damages: Notice of Arbitration May 31 2024; Gulfstream defense Aug 7 2024; ASOC Sept 9 2024; damages summaries cite roughly EUR 2.4M lost charter and replacement travel plus additional claimed categories. `test_results/query_020.json`, `test_results/query_001.json`.\n\n**Provisional Analysis**\n- Misrepresentation/negligent misstatement: The gap between estimate and actual supports materiality, but liability depends on proof that Gulfstream knew or should have known the estimate was unreliable and that reliance was reasonable in light of any estimate-only disclaimers. `test_results/query_001.json`, `test_results/query_043.json`.\n- Breach of contract/warranty: The corrosion history and prior maintenance events are central to a duty-to-disclose and warranty-breach theory; proof requires the 2020/2023 work records and warranty scope. `test_results/query_020.json`, `test_results/query_043.json`.\n- Damages/causation: Loss-of-use hinges on attributing delays to Gulfstream rather than discrepancy work, approvals, or payment issues; limitation-of-liability clauses could cap or bar consequential damages. `test_results/query_020.json`, `test_results/query_043.json`.\n\n**Priority Evidence**\n- Full Proposal Q-11876, Work Authorization T&Cs, and warranty addenda. `test_results/query_001.json`.\n- Change orders, discrepancy logs, manhour reports, and final invoices. `test_results/codex/query_055.json`.\n- July 2023 analytics outputs and historical St. Louis inspection benchmarks. `test_results/query_001.json`.\n- 2020/2023 maintenance records and corrosion findings. `test_results/query_043.json`.\n- Gulfstream defense/counterclaim and expert rebuttal reports. `test_results/codex/query_055.json`.\n\nIf you want me to proceed, tell me:\n1) Where the primary documents are (proposal, T&Cs, pleadings, expert reports).\n2) The deliverable format you want (liability memo, damages critique, evidence map, or chronology).\n3) The governing law and any clauses you want prioritized (limitations, warranty, estimate disclaimers).",
