  "output": "**Preliminary Assessment**\n- Based on the fact summary embedded in `run_codex_test.py`; I do not see the primary case record in this workspace, so this is a provisional review.\n- CITIOM owns a Gulfstream G550 (SN 5174).\n- Gulfstream performed a 192-month inspection starting 2024-01-29.\n- Original estimate: $835,931, 2,800 manhours, 35–45 business days.\n- Actual: 26,000+ manhours, completed 2024-11-29; CITIOM alleges the estimate was unreasonably low and misrepresented.\n\n**Key Legal Questions**\n- Whether the estimate/timeline in Proposal Q-11876 was a binding contractual commitment or a non-binding forecast with disclaimers.\n- Whether Gulfstream owed a duty to provide a reasonable estimate and update it as scope risks became known (negligent vs fraudulent misrepresentation).\n- Whether CITIOM reasonably relied on the estimate in making decisions and can prove causation of specific losses.\n- Whether scope expansion/unforeseen defects, change-order approvals, or customer-side delays break causation or mitigate liability.\n- Damages theory: overcharge vs loss-of-use, and any contractual limitation or exclusion of consequential damages.\n\n**Initial Exposure Assessment**\n- CITIOM’s strongest angle is the magnitude of the variance between estimate and actual time/cost, which supports an inference of an unreasonable estimate if internal benchmarks existed.\n- CITIOM’s risk is proof of scienter or lack of reasonable basis, plus any prominent estimate disclaimers that undermine reliance.\n- Gulfstream’s strongest angle is that estimates are inherently contingent and the overrun resulted from discovery of additional work and approved changes.\n- Gulfstream’s risk is evidence that internal data/analytics or prior history showed the estimate was unreliable, combined with delayed or inadequate communications.\n\n**Evidence Priorities / Gaps**\n- Customer Support Proposal Q-11876 (06/02/2023) for assumptions, exclusions, disclaimers, and change-order terms.\n- Contract documents for governing law, limitation-of-liability, and consequential-damages clauses.\n- Internal estimating worksheets, historical 192-month inspection data, and any forecasting analytics referenced in 2023.\n- Communications showing when Gulfstream recognized the overrun and how that was conveyed.\n- Expert reports from Danny Farnham and Leonard B for methodology, industry standards, and damages model.\n\n**Next Steps**\n1. Point me to the case materials in this workspace (or copy them in) and I’ll produce a document-cited memo.\n2. Tell me to proceed using only the fact summary in `run_codex_test.py` for a more detailed but clearly scoped analysis.\n3. Specify the deliverable you want (issue-spotting memo, evidence map, damages analysis, or timeline).",
