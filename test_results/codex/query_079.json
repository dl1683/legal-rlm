  "output": "**Case Snapshot**\n- Source note: This review relies on internal summaries/excerpts in `test_results/query_064.json` and `test_results/claude_code/query_069.json`; the underlying case documents are not in this workspace and should be verified.\n- Posture: Arbitration (CPR file noted in summaries) with a protective order and scheduling order; a Georgia law clause appears in a prehearing brief and should be confirmed in the executed agreement.\n- June 2, 2023 proposal for a 192-month inspection of a Gulfstream G550; estimated workscope cost $835,931, 2,800 hours, and 35-45 business days, with an April 1, 2024 return-to-service (RTS) target.\n- Aircraft inducted Jan 29, 2024; Gulfstream later cited discrepancies and moved completion to June 21, 2024; actual RTS appears around Nov 29, 2024 (some notes say Dec 2024).\n- CITIOM claims roughly EUR 2.4 million in damages tied to extended downtime and lost use.\n\n**Claims and Defenses**\n- CITIOM: breach of warranty and failure to perform repairs within a reasonable time; prior 2020 and 2023 maintenance allegedly missed corrosion; warranty repairs allegedly misclassified and billed to CITIOM.\n- CITIOM: misrepresentation or inducement based on \"express representations\" and estimates; failure to update after July 2023 analytics.\n- CITIOM: spoliation or discovery concerns tied to Gulfstream email retention and missing proposal communications.\n- Gulfstream: proposal expressly excludes discrepancy corrections and associated cost/downtime; estimates are not contractual commitments.\n- Gulfstream: delays driven by unexpected discrepancies/corrosion; substantial hours billed to warranty (summaries cite about 16,270 of about 27,000 hours, about $3.5 million).\n\n**Core Disputes and Evidence Posture**\n- What was said in pre-agreement communications and whether reliance on verbal assurances was reasonable; current summaries note limited direct evidence.\n- Foreseeability of discrepancies and whether prior inspections should have detected corrosion; expert reports are referenced but some are flagged as unverified.\n- Allocation of delay: discrepancy-driven vs process inefficiency (engineering dispositions, approvals, staffing).\n- Enforceability of limitation-of-damages terms and impact on consequential damages for downtime/lost profits.\n- Conflicting RTS dates in the summaries (Nov 29 vs Dec 2024) and the exact downtime duration.\n\n**Gaps and Next Steps**\n- Obtain the underlying proposal, work authorization T&Cs, statements of claim, prehearing briefs, and expert reports to verify quotes, dates, and contract terms.\n- Collect pre-agreement communications (emails, meeting notes, call logs) that could prove or disprove \"express representations.\"\n- Build a chronology of estimate revisions, discrepancy findings, and approval cycles to apportion delay.\n- Validate damages model inputs and assumptions, including charter revenue and out-of-pocket costs, under the governing law and contract limits.\n- Decide whether the primary liability theory should be breach of warranty, misrepresentation/inducement, or negligent process management.\n\nIf you want a focused memo (liability, damages, or discovery plan) or can share the underlying documents, tell me which direction to take.",
