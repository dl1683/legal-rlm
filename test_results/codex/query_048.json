  "output": "Based on the limited fact summary in `run_codex_test.py`, here is a preliminary review; I do not see the underlying case record in this workspace.\n\n**Preliminary Assessment**\n- Core facts: CITIOM’s G550 (SN 5174) entered a 192-month inspection on 2024-01-29; Proposal Q-11876 (2023-06-02) estimated $835,931, 2,800 manhours, 35–45 business days; actual work exceeded 26,000 manhours and completed 2024-11-29; CITIOM alleges the estimate was unreasonably low and misrepresented.\n- Likely theories: negligent/fraudulent misrepresentation based on the estimate; breach of contract or implied covenant depending on whether the estimate/timeline was contractually binding; potential unjust enrichment if charges materially exceeded reasonable expectations without valid scope change.\n- Liability hinge points: whether the estimate was a forecast with clear disclaimers vs a commitment; what Gulfstream knew or should have known about scope/risks at issuance; if/when Gulfstream updated the estimate as risks materialized; and whether CITIOM’s reliance was reasonable.\n- Defenses and risk factors: estimate disclaimers and change-order terms; unforeseen discrepancies and scope expansion; CITIOM’s approvals or delays; mitigation; and any limitation-of-liability or waiver of consequential damages clauses.\n- Damages focus: overcharge vs reliance losses (cost overrun) and loss-of-use from extended downtime; the contract’s damages limitations will drive recoverability.\n\n**Evidence Priorities**\n- Proposal Q-11876 and governing contract terms (assumptions, exclusions, disclaimers, change-order mechanics, limitation-of-liability).\n- Communications timeline showing estimate changes and notice of overruns.\n- Discrepancy reports, work authorizations, change orders, work logs, and invoices.\n- Internal estimating worksheets, historical benchmarks, and any 2023 forecasting analytics.\n- Expert reports (Danny Farnham; Leonard B) and pleadings.\n\nIf you want a full, document-cited review, please point me to the case materials in this workspace and confirm the deliverable. Options:\n1) Case brief or liability/defenses memo  \n2) Evidence map with pinpoint citations + gaps  \n3) Timeline with estimate changes  \n4) Damages and causation analysis  \n\nAlso share governing law and procedural posture if you want jurisdiction-specific analysis.",
