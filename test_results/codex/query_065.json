The scripts point to `C:\\Users\\devan\\Downloads\\CITIOM v Gulfstream\\documents`, which isn’t accessible here. Please copy the case documents into this project or point me to files within this workspace.\n\nTo get started, tell me:\n- Which deliverable you want: neutral case memo, claims/defenses analysis, evidence map, chronology, damages analysis, or depo/cross outline.\n- The governing law/tribunal and any priority issues (misrepresentation, warranty scope, limitation of liability, estimate disclaimers).\n- Whether you want a preliminary review based only on the limited summary in `run_codex_test.py` (with clear caveats) while you move the full record.\n\nIf you want, I can proceed now with a constrained preliminary memo from the summary, or wait for the full record.",
