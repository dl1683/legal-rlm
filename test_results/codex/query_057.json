The primary case record does not appear here, so everything below is provisional and should be validated against the actual pleadings, proposal, and expert reports.\n\n**Case Snapshot**\n- Summaries indicate CITIOM (Channel IT Isle of Man Ltd.) owns a Gulfstream G550 (SN 5174) and contracted for a 192‑month inspection with Gulfstream.\n- The reported proposal (Customer Support Proposal Q‑11876, June 2, 2023) estimated $835,931, 2,800 manhours, and 35‑45 business days, with an April 1, 2024 return‑to‑service target if inducted Jan 29, 2024.\n- The inspection reportedly started Jan 29, 2024, and ultimately ran to late Nov 2024 with total labor exceeding 26,000 hours.\n- Proceedings timeline in summaries: Notice of Arbitration May 31, 2024; Gulfstream notice of defense Aug 7, 2024; Amended Statement of Claim Sept 9, 2024.\n- Claimed theories include misrepresentation and breach of contract/warranty tied to corrosion history, estimating methodology, and delay.\n\n**Key Liability Issues**\n- Whether the estimate was an actionable misrepresentation (or negligent misstatement) versus a non‑binding estimate, including scope exclusions for discrepancy work.\n- Whether Gulfstream had, or should have had, better forecasting data (including alleged analytics in mid‑2023) and failed to update the estimate.\n- Reliance and causation: did CITIOM reasonably rely on the estimate/downtime, and are claimed losses attributable to misrepresentation rather than legitimate scope expansion.\n- Contractual limits: effect of estimate‑only and downtime‑disclaimer language; enforceability of limitation‑of‑liability and consequential damages waivers.\n- Damages and mitigation: quantifying delay‑driven losses vs. out‑of‑pocket costs; mitigation expectations given extended downtime.\n\n**Strengths / Risks (Provisional)**\n- CITIOM: large estimate‑to‑actual delta; alleged internal analytics/historical benchmarks; repeated RTS slips and admissions of underestimation; prior corrosion history potentially undermining unforeseeability defenses.\n- Gulfstream: estimate‑only and downtime‑disclaimer language; characterization of discrepancy work/corrosion as unpredictable; warranty scope limits and consequential‑damage waivers; arguments about CITIOM maintenance history contributing to discrepancies.\n\n**Evidence Gaps To Close**\n- Full Proposal Q‑11876 text (scope, exclusions, disclaimers).\n- Work Authorization terms and limitation‑of‑liability language.\n- Change orders, discrepancy logs, final invoices/manhour logs.\n- Internal estimating data and 2023 analytics outputs.\n- Communications timeline on estimate changes and RTS slips.\n- Maintenance records and warranty determinations for corrosion repairs.\n- Full expert reports (Farnham, damages) and Gulfstream rebuttals.\n\nIf you want a formal, document‑cited review, I need the primary case materials in this workspace or a path I can access. Natural next steps:\n1) Point me to the pleadings, proposal/T&Cs, and expert reports.\n2) Tell me the deliverable format (neutral memo, claims/defenses assessment, evidence map, damages critique, or chronology).\n3) Confirm governing law and any contract clauses you want prioritized.",
