  "output": "Based on the high-level case fact summary in `run_codex_test.py` and the internal case-memo outputs in `test_results/query_001.json` and `test_results/query_015.json`, here is a preliminary review. The underlying production documents are not in this workspace, so items flagged as unverified in those summaries should be confirmed against the source record.\n\n**Case Snapshot**\n- CITIOM (Channel IT Isle of Man Ltd.) vs Gulfstream Aerospace appears as a CPR arbitration (case G-24-115-AA) per the internal summaries.\n- Subject asset is a Gulfstream G550, serial number 5174; dispute centers on a 192-month inspection that began Jan 29, 2024.\n- Customer Support Proposal Q-11876 (June 2, 2023) estimated USD 835,931, 2,800 manhours, and 35-45 business days of downtime.\n- Actuals are reported at 26,000+ manhours with return to service around Nov 29, 2024.\n- Core claim is that the estimate was unreasonably low or misleading and induced reliance; Gulfstream attributes overruns to discrepancies and scope limits.\n\n**Liability Theories**\n- Negligent misrepresentation: estimate allegedly lacked a reasonable basis and omitted foreseeable discrepancy work.\n- Breach of contract or implied covenant: failure to deliver within a reasonable time and to manage resources consistently.\n- Professional duty of care: OEM/MRO should set realistic expectations using internal historical data and forecasting tools.\n- Prior knowledge of corrosion risk from earlier maintenance could support foreseeability and duty breach.\n\n**Defense Themes**\n- Contractual disclaimers: downtime estimates not commitments and discrepancy corrections excluded; Work Authorization T&C may bar consequential damages.\n- Unforeseen discrepancies or corrosion: overruns driven by unexpected findings rather than estimate negligence.\n- Reliance and sophistication: CITIOM used an aircraft manager (Avcon) and may have understood proposal limitations.\n- Causation breaks or mitigation: work stoppage for unpaid invoice and warranty-covered hours may reduce damages exposure.\n- Acceptance of scope: proposal acceptance with exclusions could limit misrepresentation claims.\n\n**Damages & Causation**\n- Direct cost variance is still unclear without final invoices and itemized bills.\n- Claimed consequential damages include lost charter profit (~EUR 1.613m) and replacement travel costs (~EUR 0.814m).\n- Summaries also note a failed aircraft sale claim (~EUR 1.0-1.2m), pushing total damages beyond EUR 4.1m.\n- Recovery hinges on tying losses to the initial estimate and overcoming any exclusion-of-damages clause.\n- Proof will depend on charter revenue history, sale documentation, and mitigation steps during downtime.\n\n**Evidence Gaps & Priority Follow-ups**\n- Obtain the full Proposal Q-11876 and all incorporated terms to pin down scope and disclaimer language.\n- Secure final and interim invoices, change orders, and manhour logs to quantify cost variance.\n- Seek Gulfstream's historical inspection data and any July 2023 forecasting tool records to prove knowledge.\n- Authenticate and depose expert witnesses (D. Farnham; damages expert; Gulfstream rebuttal) to test assumptions.\n- Build a definitive timeline of RTS updates, staffing levels, and any payment-related stoppages.\n\nIf you want, I can produce a document-cited memo once the underlying case documents are available.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Point me to the case document folder so I can cite the actual exhibits and filings.\n2. Tell me which claim angle you want emphasized (misrepresentation, contract, or damages) for a deeper dive.\n3. Ask for a draft outline of deposition topics for the key Gulfstream witnesses.",
