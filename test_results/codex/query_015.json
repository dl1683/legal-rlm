  "output": "I looked for case materials in the workspace and only found a brief fact summary embedded in `run_codex_test.py`; there are no pleadings, contracts, exhibits, or expert reports here. The scripts reference an external folder (`C:\\Users\\devan\\Downloads\\CITIOM v Gulfstream\\documents`), but it’s not in this repo. I can give a preliminary assessment from the limited facts, or a full document‑grounded review once you point me to the record.\n\nPreliminary assessment (limited record from `run_codex_test.py`)\n- Likely claims: negligent/fraudulent misrepresentation (estimate lacked reasonable basis), breach of contract (if estimate/timeline was part of the bargain), breach of implied covenant (if Gulfstream knew the estimate was unreliable and failed to disclose).\n- Core liability questions: whether the estimate was contractually binding or expressly disclaimed; what Gulfstream knew about scope/risks when it issued the estimate; whether it updated CITIOM as overruns became apparent; and whether CITIOM’s reliance was reasonable.\n- Likely defenses: estimate as non‑binding forecast; scope expansion and unforeseen defects; customer approvals or delays; limitation of liability and waiver of consequential damages; mitigation failures.\n- Damages framing: reliance (overrun vs. estimate), loss‑of‑use/downtime costs, and any consequential losses—subject to contractual caps/waivers and causation.\n\nTo proceed, tell me which deliverable you want and where the case documents live. I can do:\n1. Executive case synopsis + timeline\n2. Claims/defenses analysis with element‑by‑element support\n3. Evidence map with citation targets and gaps\n4. Damages theory analysis (reliance vs. expectancy, limitation clauses)\n5. Deposition/cross‑exam prep outlines\n\nIf you want a full review, please copy the documents into this workspace or point me to the specific folder/files to use.",
