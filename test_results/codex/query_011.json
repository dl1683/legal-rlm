  "output": "Here is a preliminary review based only on the limited fact summary in `run_codex_test.py`; I do not see the underlying case document set in this workspace (scripts reference `C:\\Users\\devan\\Downloads\\CITIOM v Gulfstream\\documents`), so the analysis is provisional.\n\n**Case Snapshot**\n- CITIOM owns a Gulfstream G550 (SN 5174).\n- Gulfstream performed a 192-month inspection starting 01/29/2024.\n- Proposal Q-11876 (06/02/2023) estimated $835,931, 2,800 manhours, 35-45 business days.\n- Actual work reached 26,000+ manhours and completed 11/29/2024.\n- CITIOM claims the estimate was unreasonably low and misrepresented.\n\n**Liability Analysis**\n- Negligent misrepresentation is the cleanest fit if the estimate was provided as professional information without a reasonable basis; the gap between 2,800 and 26,000 manhours is a red flag but still requires proof of unreasonable methodology or ignored data.\n- Fraudulent misrepresentation is possible only if evidence shows Gulfstream knew the estimate was unreliable or intentionally low and intended CITIOM to rely on it.\n- Breach of contract or implied covenant depends on whether the estimate or schedule was incorporated into the agreement or if Gulfstream failed to follow agreed change-order/notice procedures.\n- Reliance and causation will hinge on whether CITIOM made specific decisions based on the estimate and whether those decisions would have been different with an accurate estimate.\n- Damages theory must link the overrun to misrepresentation rather than legitimate scope expansion or discovered defects.\n\n**Defenses and Risks**\n- Estimate may be framed as non-binding or subject to change, which weakens misrepresentation and contract theories.\n- Scope expansion, unforeseen defects, and parts availability can justify higher cost and time if well documented.\n- Change orders or approvals by CITIOM can shift causation and reduce recoverable damages.\n- Contractual limitation of liability or exclusion of consequential damages could cap downtime or loss-of-use claims.\n- Reasonableness of reliance is a key risk if disclaimers or industry practice signal that estimates are preliminary.\n\n**Evidence Priorities**\n- Proposal Q-11876 for assumptions, disclaimers, and how the estimate was presented.\n- Contract terms on estimates, change orders, notice obligations, and limitation of liability.\n- Internal estimating worksheets, historical benchmarks for 192-month inspections, and forecasting analytics.\n- Communications showing when Gulfstream knew the estimate would be exceeded and how that was conveyed.\n- Work logs, change orders, and invoices tying the overrun to specific scope or defect discoveries.\n- Expert reports (Danny Farnham, Leonard B) on estimating methodology and industry standards.\n\nIf you want a full memo grounded in the record, please point me to the case documents or confirm you want me to proceed using only this limited summary. If you want a specific deliverable, pick one:\n1. Issues/claims/defenses memo with liability assessment\n2. Evidence map keyed to the documents\n3. Damages theory analysis (reliance vs. expectancy, limits, causation)",
