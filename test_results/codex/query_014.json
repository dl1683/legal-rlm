  "output": "I can give a preliminary review based only on the key facts embedded in `run_codex_test.py`; I do not see the underlying case documents in this workspace, so anything deeper needs those materials.\n\n**Preliminary Review (limited record)**\n- **Core facts:** CITIOM owns a Gulfstream G550 (SN 5174); a 192-month inspection began 2024-01-29; estimate was $835,931 / 2,800 manhours / 35-45 business days; actual work grew to 26,000+ manhours and finished 2024-11-29; CITIOM says the estimate was unreasonably low and misrepresented; key documents flagged are Customer Support Proposal Q-11876 (2023-06-02) and expert reports from Danny Farnham and Leonard B. (`run_codex_test.py`)\n- **Primary liability questions:** Was the estimate a contractual commitment or a non-binding forecast? Did Gulfstream owe a duty to provide a reasonable estimate and update it as scope risks became known? Did Gulfstream have information (prior inspections, internal data) that made the estimate unreliable when given?\n- **Likely CITIOM theories:** Negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation (estimate lacked reasonable basis), breach of contract if the estimate or timeline was part of the bargain, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith if delays or deprioritization were not disclosed.\n- **Likely Gulfstream defenses:** Estimate disclaimers and scope exclusions in the proposal; inspection findings required additional work; delays tied to customer approvals or change orders; limitation of liability and consequential-damages waivers.\n- **Damages framing:** Overrun vs. estimate (if reliance-based), loss of use/downtime costs, and any consequential losses that are foreseeable and not contractually barred; causation and mitigation will be central.\n\n**Key Gaps To Close**\n- The actual proposal and contract language (especially estimate disclaimers, scope exclusions, change-order process, and limitation clauses).\n- Communications that show when Gulfstream knew the estimate was likely to be exceeded and what it told CITIOM.\n- Work logs, change orders, and internal forecasting data supporting or undermining reasonableness of the original estimate.\n- The expert reports themselves (methodologies, assumptions, and any rebuttals).\n\nIf you want a full, document-grounded review, point me to the case materials in this repo or a specific folder. What deliverable do you want next?\n1. Executive case synopsis + timeline\n2. Issues/claims/defenses analysis\n3. Evidence map with gaps and priority cites\n4. Damages theory analysis\n5. Deposition or cross-exam prep",
