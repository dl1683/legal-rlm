(CITIOM) owns a G550 (SN 5174) managed by Avcon Jet; Gulfstream performed the 192‑month inspection at St. Louis under a June 2, 2023 proposal.\n- CITIOM alleges the proposal estimated $835,931, ~2,800 hours, and 35–45 business days; it relied on those estimates and later faced repeated RTS extensions.\n- CITIOM says Gulfstream’s delays were driven by staffing/inefficiency and outsourcing; Gulfstream says severe corrosion drove unprecedented scope growth.\n- Governing framework: Work Authorization Agreement calls for CPR arbitration and Georgia law (as cited in the Statement of Claim).\n\n**Claims and Defenses**\n- CITIOM pleads seven causes: breach of warranty, willful/gross negligence in repairs, unconscionability, FBPA, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent/reckless misrepresentation, and fraud in the inducement; seeks at least $4.8M in loss‑of‑use and related damages.\n- Gulfstream’s core defense is contractual: the proposal repeatedly disclaims discrepancy correction costs/downtime, and treats downtime as a non‑binding estimate.\n- Gulfstream highlights extraordinary corrosion, a fleet average of ~5,400 hours vs. >27,000 hours on this aircraft, and substantial warranty‑covered labor (>16,000 hours).\n- Gulfstream disputes FBPA applicability (private transaction), challenges reliance due to sophisticated aviation professionals, and asserts a counterclaim for abusive litigation plus fees/costs.\n\n**Key Legal Pressure Points**\n- Misrepresentation/fraud: hinges on whether the proposal and later communications were materially misleading given disclaimers, and whether Gulfstream had contrary internal knowledge (analytics/forecasting) when it quoted.\n- Reliance and causation: if the proposal is clear and CITIOM’s representatives were sophisticated, justifiable reliance is a major hurdle; causation also turns on whether corrosion would have driven the same downtime regardless.\n- Unconscionability: CITIOM’s “take‑it‑or‑leave‑it” and no‑delay‑liability arguments face the counterweight of commercial sophistication and ability to choose other MROs.\n- Damages: proposal terms (as reproduced in the brief) include exclusions of consequential damages (loss of use, lost profits) and “no delay remedies,” which may bar or narrow recovery unless invalidated.\n\n**Evidence Priorities**\n- Full proposal text and acceptance (including downtime/estimate language and discrepancy disclaimers) to pin down contract interpretation.\n- Internal Gulfstream analytics and historical inspection data for knowledge/foreseeability of scope growth.\n- Communications that might override or contradict proposal disclaimers (emails/letters giving specific RTS commitments).\n- Expert testimony on industry standards for estimating discrepancies and on causation of downtime.\n- Warranty terms and repair history (144‑month/2023 visits) to support or refute the warranty and corrosion allegations.\n\nIf you want, I can drill down into specific claims or pull targeted excerpts from the expert reports or key exhibits next. Suggested next steps:\n1. Review the expert reports for industry‑standard and causation opinions.\n2. Extract and summarize the exact proposal/WAA clauses on downtime, discrepancies, and damages exclusions.",
