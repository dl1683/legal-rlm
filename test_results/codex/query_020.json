  "output": "I can start a preliminary review from the short fact summary in `run_codex_test.py`, but the actual case record isn’t in this workspace; the scripts point to `C:\\Users\\devan\\Downloads\\CITIOM v Gulfstream\\documents`, which I can’t access here. If you want a document‑grounded review, please copy the relevant files into this project or point me to files within this workspace.\n\n**Preliminary review (summary‑only, from `run_codex_test.py`)**\n- Core dispute: CITIOM’s G550 (SN 5174) underwent a 192‑month inspection starting 01/29/2024; Gulfstream’s initial estimate was ~$835,931 / 2,800 manhours / 35–45 business days; actual work reportedly expanded to 26,000+ manhours and completed 11/29/2024.\n- Key liability theories likely in play: negligent misrepresentation (estimate lacked a reasonable basis), fraudulent misrepresentation (knowledge of unreliability + intent to induce reliance), breach of contract / implied covenant (if estimate or schedule was incorporated or relied on contractually), and possibly promissory estoppel if contract terms are unfavorable.\n- Critical fault lines: whether the estimate was expressly non‑binding and subject to change; whether Gulfstream had sufficient historical data or internal analytics to know the estimate was unreliable; when Gulfstream knew the estimate would be exceeded; and whether CITIOM’s reliance was reasonable given any disclaimers.\n- Damages issues to scrutinize: direct overrun vs. consequential loss‑of‑use; foreseeability and causation; mitigation; and any contractual caps/waivers.\n- Defense themes to expect: unforeseen defects/corrosion and scope expansion; estimate disclaimers; change‑order approvals; customer delays or lack of timely responses; and contractual limitation‑of‑liability provisions.\n\n**Evidence priorities (once docs are available)**\n- Proposal Q‑11876 (assumptions, scope limits, disclaimers, incorporation into contract).\n- Contract terms (estimate status, change‑order process, liability caps, damages waivers).\n- Internal estimating files and any 2023 forecasting analytics.\n- Communications timeline showing when Gulfstream first signaled overruns.\n- Work orders, discrepancy lists, labor logs, invoices tying overruns to specific discoveries.\n- Prior inspection history and corrosion condition at intake.\n\nIf you want a full review, tell me which materials to use or move them into the repo. I can also proceed using only existing `test_results/*.json` outputs (with clear caveats about unverified excerpts), but it’s weaker.\n\nPick one:\n1. Share or copy in the case documents you want reviewed.\n2. Confirm you want me to proceed using only `run_codex_test.py` (summary‑only memo).\n3. Confirm you want me to use the generated excerpts in `test_results/` (with caveats).\n4. Specify a focused deliverable (e.g., claims/defenses memo, evidence map, damages analysis, or timeline).",
