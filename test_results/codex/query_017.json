  "status": "completed",
  "elapsed_seconds": 102.4,
  "output": "**Findings**\n- Critical: I only see a brief fact summary in `run_codex_test.py` and no pleadings, contracts, proposal, communications, or expert reports in this workspace, so this is not a document-cited review.\n- High: Liability analysis turns on the estimate’s contractual status, disclaimers, scope exclusions, change-order process, and limitation-of-liability clauses, which are not available.\n- High: Any misrepresentation theory depends on what Gulfstream knew at the time of the estimate (prior inspection data, internal analytics, scope assumptions) and whether it was disclosed; those materials are missing.\n- Medium: Damages cannot be assessed without invoices, manhour logs, downtime records, and mitigation evidence to separate reliance loss from potentially barred consequential losses.\n- Medium: Causation and allocation of delay require a communications/change-order timeline that is not in the record here.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Was Customer Support Proposal Q-11876 incorporated into a binding agreement or labeled as a non-binding estimate?\n- What contemporaneous data did Gulfstream have about scope risks when it issued the June 2, 2023 estimate?\n- When were overruns first communicated and what approvals did CITIOM give?\n- What contractual limits apply to loss-of-use or consequential damages?\n\n**Preliminary Assessment (based on the limited facts)**\n- Facts available in `run_codex_test.py`: CITIOM’s G550 (SN 5174) entered a 192-month inspection on 2024-01-29; estimate was $835,931 / 2,800 manhours / 35-45 business days; actual work exceeded 26,000 manhours and completed 2024-11-29; CITIOM alleges the estimate was unreasonably low and misrepresented.\n- Potential claims: negligent/fraudulent misrepresentation if the estimate lacked a reasonable basis and reliance was justified; breach of contract or implied covenant if the estimate/timeline formed part of the bargain.\n- Likely defenses: estimate treated as a forecast with disclaimers; scope expansion/unforeseen conditions; customer approvals or delays; contractual caps/waivers on damages.\n- Damages framing: reliance (overrun vs estimate) and downtime/loss-of-use costs, subject to contractual limitations and causation proof.\n\nIf you want a document-grounded review, please point me to the case record within this workspace. I can then deliver:\n1) Document-cited case memo (issues, claims/defenses, liability assessment)  \n2) Evidence map with citations and gaps  \n3) Damages theory analysis (reliance vs expectancy, limitations)",
