  "output": "Reviewed the core pleadings and both pre‑hearing briefs and pulled the main disputes and pressure points.\n\n**Case Snapshot**\n- Forum: CPR arbitration under the FAA; Georgia law governs per the Work Authorization terms.\n- Parties/asset: CITIOM (Channel IT Isle of Man) vs Gulfstream; G550 SN 5174; St. Louis service center.\n- Proposal (June 2, 2023): $835,931, 2,800 manhours, 35–45 business days; dispute over whether estimates covered only inspection tasks vs full discrepancies.\n- Timeline: aircraft input Jan 29, 2024; CITIOM says return in Nov 2024 vs Apr 1, 2024 target; Gulfstream attributes delay to severe corrosion and 27,000+ hours with 16,270 hours billed to warranty.\n- Claims/counterclaims: seven counts (warranty, gross negligence, unconscionability, FBPA, negligent/fraud misrep, fraud in inducement); damages claimed ≥ $4.8M; Gulfstream counterclaims for abusive litigation and fees.\n\n**Claimant Themes (CITIOM)**\n- Gulfstream allegedly knew estimates were outdated given prior maintenance history and July 2023 analytics but did not update.\n- Alleged continuing misstatements in March–April 2024 as completion dates slipped.\n- Poor execution at St. Louis (staffing/training/quality) plus corrosion that should have been addressed in 2020/2023; warranty repairs delayed or mishandled.\n- Damages include warranty overcharges, downtime/loss of use, replacement travel/charter, and failed resale; FAZ estimates ~2.5M economic loss plus other items to reach ≥ $4.8M.\n- Seeks damages, fees/costs, and interest.\n\n**Respondent Themes (Gulfstream)**\n- Proposal expressly limits quoted cost/downtime to inspection tasks; discrepancy repairs excluded and estimates non‑binding.\n- CITIOM had experienced aviation agents (Avcon Jet, Farnham), weakening justifiable reliance.\n- Unprecedented corrosion drove scope; fleet average ~5,400 hours vs 27,000+ here; majority of work billed to warranty at Gulfstream cost.\n- Contract bars delay and consequential damages; limitations enforceable under Georgia law; unconscionability claim fails.\n- Counterclaim for abusive litigation and request for fees/costs.\n\n**Key Legal/Evidentiary Issues**\n- Actionability of estimates vs non‑binding opinions; effect of disclaimer language on reliance and scienter.\n- Duty to update after July 2023 analytics; evidence of knowledge that estimates were materially low.\n- Warranty breach vs scope growth: causation and whether prior repairs were deficient.\n- Causation/damages: link to misrepresentation vs aircraft condition; enforceability of damages waivers.\n- FBPA applicability in this B2B context and the bar for willful/gross negligence.\n\n**Evidence Priorities**\n- Proposal + Work Authorization terms (disclaimers, warranty scope, limitation‑of‑liability, delay exclusions).\n- Internal estimating analytics and methodology in 2023; proof of any decision not to update.\n- Communications on revised estimates and staffing between Jan–Jun 2024.\n- Maintenance records for 144‑month and July 2023 work; discrepancy logs/corrosion findings.\n- Manhour logs, warranty billing split, and change orders to separate inspection vs discrepancy repairs.\n- Damages proof for lost use, charter/replacement travel, sale collapse, and mitigation.\n\n**Sources Reviewed**\n- `C:\\Users\\devan\\Downloads\\CITIOM v Gulfstream\\documents\\CITIOM Amended Statement of Claim.pdf`\n- `C:\\Users\\devan\\Downloads\\CITIOM v Gulfstream\\documents\\Pre Hearing Brief\\Claimant CITIOM Pre-Hearing Brief - Apr 14 2025 (1).pdf` (marked Highly Confidential)\n- `C:\\Users\\devan\\Downloads\\CITIOM v Gulfstream\\documents\\Gulfstream - Prehearing Brief .pdf`\n\nIf you want a deeper dive, I can:\n1) Build a dated timeline with exhibit citations.  \n2) Draft an element‑by‑element proof matrix for each claim/defense.  \n3) Summarize and stress‑test the expert reports (Farnham/FAZ/GS expert).",
