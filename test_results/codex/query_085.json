If you want a deeper review (exhibits, expert reports, discovery), point me to the exact folders.\n\n**Case Snapshot**\n- Arbitration under CPR Rules (Case No. G-24-115-AA) with Georgia law/FAA referenced in the work authorization terms.\n- Claimant: Channel IT Isle of Man Ltd. (CITIOM), owner of G550 SN 5174; Respondent: Gulfstream Aerospace.\n- Core dispute: 192‑month inspection at St. Louis; proposal estimated ~$835,931 and 35–45 working days/2,800 hours, but downtime extended into late 2024.\n- CITIOM seeks at least $4.8M (loss of use and related damages) plus cover/refund of repair payments, fees, and interest.\n- Gulfstream denies liability and seeks fees/costs and asserts abusive‑litigation counterclaim.\n\n**CITIOM Allegations**\n- Proposal and RTS estimates were misleading given Gulfstream’s experience and data; CITIOM says Gulfstream failed to revise despite new analytics.\n- Corrosion and other discrepancies should have been found and addressed during prior Gulfstream maintenance (144‑month, July 2023).\n- Gulfstream repeatedly extended RTS dates (June → August → September → November/December 2024) and was allegedly understaffed.\n- Claims asserted: breach of warranty, willful/gross negligence, unconscionability, FBPA, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent/reckless misrepresentation, fraud in the inducement.\n- Damages framed primarily as loss of use and related economic losses, currently pleaded at least $4.8M and growing.\n\n**Gulfstream Positions**\n- Proposal clearly stated estimates covered inspection only, excluding discrepancy repairs; “not a contractual commitment.”\n- Claimant’s agents (Avcon Jet/Farnham) were experienced and familiar with this quoting model from prior proposals.\n- Inspection tasks completed within estimated timeframe; delays were caused by unprecedented corrosion (27,000 hours vs ~5,400 fleet average).\n- Significant work billed to warranty (16,270 hours; ~$3.5M), undermining breach allegations.\n- Work Authorization releases delay liability, waives consequential damages, and limits remedies; FBPA inapplicable to private transaction; seeks fees/costs and abusive‑litigation relief.\n\n**Key Disputes**\n- Whether the proposal and subsequent RTS communications can be reasonably construed as full‑visit promises.\n- Whether Gulfstream knew or should have known the inspection would require extraordinary discrepancy work.\n- Causation of downtime: aircraft condition vs Gulfstream staffing/repair execution.\n- Warranty scope and “reasonable time” to repair specific defects under Georgia law.\n- Damages theory versus contractual waivers and limitations.\n\n**Preliminary Risk Notes**\n- Misrepresentation claims rise or fall on proposal language, reliance by sophisticated agents, and any internal evidence of known underestimation.\n- CITIOM’s strongest path is likely showing Gulfstream’s knowledge of likely scope growth and actionable post‑proposal assurances.\n- Warranty claim looks thin without specific defects that went unrepaired within a reasonable time.\n- Unconscionability/FBPA claims appear weak given private, sophisticated transaction and Georgia precedent.\n- Consequential‑damage waivers may significantly limit loss‑of‑use damages unless invalidated.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Exact wording in the signed proposal/attachments and any written RTS updates that could override disclaimers.\n- Maintenance logs from 144‑month and July 2023 work showing what was inspected, corrosion found, and repairs completed.\n- Final RTS date and verified labor hours/costs, including what was billed vs warranty‑covered.\n- Evidence of staffing/resource decisions at St. Louis and impact on repair timeline.\n- Documentation supporting the $4.8M loss‑of‑use figure and mitigation efforts.\n- Status of spoliation allegations and the scope of retained communications.\n\nIf you want, I can go deeper into specific exhibits (proposal, work authorizations, maintenance records, expert reports) and build a timeline with pinpoint citations.",
