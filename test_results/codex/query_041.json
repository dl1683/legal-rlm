  "status": "completed",
  "elapsed_seconds": 132.0,
  "output": "Based on the limited facts available in this workspace (a short case summary, not the underlying exhibits), here is a preliminary review and what I need to proceed with a full analysis.\n\n**Preliminary Review**\n- Known facts: CITIOM owns a Gulfstream G550 (SN 5174); Gulfstream began a 192‑month inspection on 2024‑01‑29; Proposal Q‑11876 (2023‑06‑02) estimated $835,931, 2,800 manhours, and 35–45 business days; actual work reportedly exceeded 26,000 manhours and completed 2024‑11‑29; CITIOM alleges the estimate was unreasonably low/misleading.\n- Liability themes: whether the estimate was a reasonable forecast vs. a non‑binding estimate; what Gulfstream knew (or should have known) about historical downtime/defect scope; reliance and causation.\n- Contract defenses: estimate/disclaimer language, change‑order process, and whether unforeseen discrepancies reasonably explain scope growth.\n- Damages: cost overrun, extended downtime, and any consequential loss‑of‑use theory; mitigation and proximate cause will be central.\n- Evidence priorities: Proposal Q‑11876, work authorizations, change orders, internal estimating data/analytics, communications on scope/delay, and expert reports (Farnham, Beauchemin).\n\n**What I Need To Proceed**\n- The underlying case documents are not present in this workspace. Please place them in the project folder or point me to their paths under `C:\\Users\\devan\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Projects\\RLMs\\`.\n- Choose the deliverable you want first:\n  1) full liability/defenses memo\n  2) detailed timeline with estimate revisions\n  3) damages and causation analysis\n\nWhich option should I start with, and can you share the Proposal and pleadings/expert reports?",
