  "output": "Based on the limited fact summary in `run_codex_test.py`, here is a preliminary legal review. I do not have the underlying contract, pleadings, or record in this workspace, so this is non-jurisdiction-specific and provisional.\n\n**Case Snapshot**\n- CITIOM owns a Gulfstream G550 (SN 5174).\n- Gulfstream performed a 192-month inspection starting 2024-01-29.\n- Estimate in Customer Support Proposal Q-11876 (2023-06-02): $835,931, 2,800 manhours, 35-45 business days.\n- Actual performance reported: 26,000+ manhours, completion 2024-11-29.\n- CITIOM alleges the estimate was unreasonably low and misrepresented; expert reports by Danny Farnham and Leonard B. are noted.\n\n**Key Liability Questions**\n- Was the estimate a binding commitment or a non-binding forecast with disclaimers?\n- What did Gulfstream know or reasonably should have known about scope and likely cost at issuance?\n- Were overruns disclosed timely, and did CITIOM reasonably rely on the estimate?\n- Did discrepancy-driven scope expansion or corrosion break causation?\n- What industry standard of care governs MRO estimating and project management?\n\n**Potential Claims**\n- Negligent misrepresentation regarding the reliability of the estimate.\n- Fraudulent misrepresentation if knowledge or reckless disregard can be shown.\n- Breach of contract if estimate/time commitments were incorporated into the agreement.\n- Breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n\n**Defense Themes**\n- Estimate expressly non-binding with reliance or limitation disclaimers.\n- Overrun driven by newly discovered discrepancies or added scope.\n- CITIOM approvals, decisions, or delays contributed to time and cost.\n- Limitation-of-liability or waiver-of-consequential-damages clauses limit recovery.\n\n**Damages Focus**\n- Reliance damages tied to the difference between the estimate and actual costs.\n- Expectation damages only if a binding price/time term exists.\n- Consequential losses from downtime or loss of use, subject to contractual limits.\n- Mitigation steps and alternative options considered by CITIOM.\n\n**Evidence Priorities**\n- Full Customer Support Proposal Q-11876 and governing terms and conditions.\n- Communications timeline around estimate changes and notice of overruns.\n- Change orders, discrepancy reports, work orders, and manhour logs.\n- Internal estimating data, models, and historical benchmarks.\n- Expert reports (Farnham; Leonard B.) and their methodologies.\n- Invoices and payment history to quantify approvals and damages.\n\nIf you want a full, cited memo, point me to the case record files and the governing law. I can produce:\n1) A neutral case brief and procedural posture memo.\n2) A claims/defenses proof map with an evidence matrix.\n3) A damages and mitigation analysis with a draft chronology.",
