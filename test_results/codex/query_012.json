  "output": "**Preliminary Review**\n- Working from the limited fact summary in `run_codex_test.py`; I do not have the underlying case record in this workspace (the scripts point to `C:\\Users\\devan\\Downloads\\CITIOM v Gulfstream\\documents`).\n- Known facts: CITIOM’s G550 (SN 5174) underwent a 192‑month inspection starting 01/29/2024; Proposal Q‑11876 (06/02/2023) estimated $835,931 / 2,800 manhours / 35–45 business days; actual work ran 26,000+ manhours and finished 11/29/2024.\n- Core allegation: CITIOM contends the initial estimate was unreasonably low and misrepresented.\n\n**Liability Analysis (Provisional)**\n- Negligent misrepresentation: strongest fit if Gulfstream provided professional estimates without a reasonable basis; the 2,800 vs. 26,000+ manhour gap is a red flag, but liability turns on estimating methodology and known aircraft history.\n- Fraudulent misrepresentation: requires proof Gulfstream knew the estimate was unreliable and intended reliance; hinges on internal communications, forecasting analytics, and any “lowball” directives.\n- Breach of contract / implied covenant: depends on whether the estimate and schedule were incorporated into the agreement and whether change‑order/notice obligations were followed.\n- Reliance and causation: CITIOM must show it made specific decisions based on the estimate and that damages flowed from the misrepresentation rather than legitimate scope discoveries.\n\n**Defense Themes**\n- Estimate characterized as non‑binding and subject to change; reliance may be unreasonable if disclaimers are prominent.\n- Unforeseen defects and scope expansion justify cost/time increases if documented and disclosed promptly.\n- Contractual limitations on liability, sole‑remedy clauses, or consequential‑damages waivers could cap loss‑of‑use recovery.\n- CITIOM’s approvals or delayed responses may break causation or reduce damages.\n\n**Evidence Priorities**\n- Proposal Q‑11876 for assumptions, disclaimers, and scope boundaries.\n- Internal estimating worksheets, historical benchmarks for 192‑month inspections, and any 2023 forecasting analytics.\n- Communications showing when Gulfstream knew the estimate would be exceeded and how/when it informed CITIOM.\n- Change orders, work logs, and invoices tying the overrun to specific discrepancies.\n\n**Gaps to Close**\n- Governing law and contract terms (estimate status, change‑order process, limitation clauses).\n- Content of expert reports (Danny Farnham, Leonard B) on estimating methodology and industry norms.\n- Specific damages theory (overcharge vs. loss‑of‑use) and supporting calculations.\n- Timeline of revised estimates and CITIOM’s decision points.\n\nIf you want a full, document‑cited analysis, please choose one option:\n1. Share the case materials in this workspace (or point me to a subset) and I’ll produce a formal memo.  \n2. Confirm you want me to proceed using only the limited summary in `run_codex_test.py`.  \n3. Specify the exact deliverable and jurisdiction (e.g., liability memo, evidence map, damages analysis).",
