  "output": "**Sources And Limits**\n- I only have extracted summaries in `test_results/query_001.json`, `test_results/query_020.json`, `test_results/query_024.json`, `test_results/query_043.json`; many citations in those summaries are marked unverified.\n- Scripts in this repo point to the primary document set at `C:\\Users\\devan\\Downloads\\CITIOM v Gulfstream\\documents`, which is outside the current workspace.\n- This is a preliminary review based on those summaries, not a verification of the underlying documents.\n- If you want a citation-grade analysis, I need the actual PDFs/Word files in the workspace.\n\n**Preliminary Case Synopsis (From Available Summaries)**\n- Parties/arbitration: Channel IT Isle of Man Ltd (CITIOM) vs Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation; CPR case G-24-115-AA; aircraft G550 SN 5174.\n- June 2, 2023 proposal Q-11876 Rev 0: approx $835,931, 2,800 man-hours, 35-45 business days; expected RTS April 1, 2024 if input Jan 29, 2024.\n- Inspection began late Jan 2024 at St. Louis; repeated RTS revisions (June 21, 2024 and later) with out-of-service into late 2024.\n- Procedural milestones: Notice of Arbitration May 31, 2024; Gulfstream response Aug 7, 2024; Amended Statement of Claim Sept 9, 2024.\n\n**Key Liability Themes And Defenses (As Reflected In Summaries)**\n- Misrepresentation theory: proposal allegedly omitted discrepancy-related costs/downtime and did not incorporate Gulfstream historical data or July 2023 analytics before approval; CITIOM claims reliance.\n- Contract/warranty theory: delays, prior corrosion handling, staffing or planning issues; damages framed around lost use and cost overruns.\n- Defense posture: proposal language that downtime estimates are not contractual commitments; Work Authorization T&C disclaim consequential damages; overruns attributed to unforeseeable discrepancies/corrosion.\n- Evidence pivot points: internal analytics data, historical inspection durations at St. Louis, and whether delays stemmed from customer approvals vs internal bottlenecks.\n\n**Evidence Gaps To Close**\n- Missing primary documents: full June 2, 2023 proposal Q-11876, work orders and discrepancy reports, final invoice, and internal communications.\n- Most supporting documents cited in the summaries are marked unverified; authentication is needed before relying on them.\n- Full expert reports and exhibits (Farnham, Beauchemin, FAZ) are central but not available here.\n- Conflicting or imprecise input/RTS dates in the summaries mean a master chronology is still needed.\n\n**Next Steps**\n- Please share the underlying case documents in the workspace or point me to an accessible path so I can verify citations.\n- Confirm whether you want me to proceed now using only the summary outputs.\n- If you want a specific deliverable, pick: 1) liability memo, 2) damages critique, 3) chronology with citations, 4) witness/expert assessment.\n- If there is a priority issue (e.g., misrepresentation elements, damages, or procedural posture), tell me and I will start there.",
