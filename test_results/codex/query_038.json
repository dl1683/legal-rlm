I don’t see the actual case record in this workspace; the scripts point to `C:\\Users\\devan\\Downloads\\CITIOM v Gulfstream\\documents`, which isn’t available here. Please point me to the case files inside `C:\\Users\\devan\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Projects\\RLMs` (or copy them in), and tell me the deliverable you want.\n\nPick one (or combine):\n1) Document‑cited case memo (facts, issues, claims/defenses, liability assessment)  \n2) Evidence map with pinpoint citations + gaps  \n3) Damages analysis (reliance vs. expectancy; limitation‑of‑liability impact)  \n4) Timeline + key communications/estimate changes  \n5) Answer a specific question\n\nIf you want a preliminary review based only on the limited summary info already in the repo, say so and I’ll proceed with clear caveats.",
